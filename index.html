                                    <h5 class="text-uppercase">INTRODUCTION</h5>
                                    <p>
                                        Rumours are a deadly weapon that affects the morale of the people. But tensions have always been a breeding ground of information operations. A few years ago, ‘fake news’ was a rarely used term but with the civilisation of social media it has put us into a grave position leading us to face fake news. 
                                        Today, it has become one of the greatest threats to the civilians of our society where the society believes in every rumour on social media platform. These days the manipulation of the facts is just the propaganda of whistleblowers. Both, information and misinformation are at our fingertips. This only means that it is almost as easy to spread fake news as it is to verify it. At present internet is the only nexus between the audience where the world at large itself is an audience and recipients. Thus, social media is often accused of shaping public debate and unfairly engineering people's behaviour and undermining the democratic process instead of nurturing a healthy public sphere. 
                                        Humans have an essential role in spreading the word. The effortless access to the internet world is both a boon and bane. Every coin has its two sides. The heart of this Article lies in the other side that is the bane of easily accessible social media networks. Rolling out fake news is no trifling act. People at large are overworked and become pretentious by the same cause. ‘Fake news’ has become a global concern since the rise of unpleasant incidents that have challenged the users’ trust in the news, especially through social media. There are no adequate preventive measures taken to curb the spreading of fake news and to hold people accountable for committing it.
                                        <br>
                                         Fake news not only turned out to be a curse for the common man, who find it difficult to distinguish from fiction but also for law enforcement agencies. Unlike other countries, the prime distributor of fake news in India is WhatsApp, but not other social networking sites like Facebook or Twitter. It has not only misinformed the users on social media but also triggered violence and barbaric killings around the country. In a country where innocents have been brutally killed by panicked mobs on the basis of rumours of child kidnappers spread on WhatsApp, this seems a justifiable fear. More so when there are a number of websites pretending to be news websites that peddle all sorts of hateful, communal propaganda with the tacit blessing of the ruling dispensation. According to a Microsoft report, Indian internet users are more likely to have been subjected to fake news than any others.

                                    <h5 class="text-uppercase">OUTBREAK OF ‘FAKE NEWS’</h5>
                                    <p>
                                        
                                            • Citizenship amendment act (CAA)
                                        One huge instance of outspreading of fake news before the COVID-19 cause came into the scene was the CAA (Citizenship Amendment Act)1 where the government was accused of establishing “Hindutva” over the nation. Uninformed and poorly literate population of the country demeaned the Act summoning it of being inaugurated against the Islamic Believers. The news channels also played a vital role in portrayal of communalism. The common unlearned man could not only grasp the language but also exhibited utter confusion led to spreading of fake news. Fake news doesn’t evolve intentionally always. Sometimes misconstruction of thoughts and ideas conveyed under common understanding configure fake news. Looking back at the time of debates involving CAA, a lot of communal riots arose over the nation. <br>
                                            • COVID 19 (Corona)
                                        Glancing at the current time, the common man already started declaring certain facts and the remedial actions speculated to be taken under the name of the government. All of this focuses on leading to rolling out of misinformation and immediately forming an opinion in the minds of civilians. For an instance, when LOCKDOWN: 1 ended, hundreds of labourers flocked to the stations hoping for the trains to commence the journeys taking them back to their hometown. 
                                        While dealing with the set of circumstances, the Supreme Court of India held that the migration of large number of labourers working in the cities was triggered by panic created by fake news that the lock down would continue for more than three months2. Such panic caused migration and untold suffering to those who believed and acted on such fake news. In fact, some of the labourers have lost their lives while walking for hundreds of miles on foot. It is therefore not possible for us to overlook this menace of fake news either by electronic, print or social media. 
                                        Amidst the pandemic of the corona virus, our nation is facing internal pandemic - fake news. The news channels actively blamed the Muslim community for the spread which later led to the repercussions on them apologizing for spreading hate against the community. The public health departments also face grave challenges in dealing with the spread of fake news. The public health department has spent sleepless night and struggling days to in order to curb this virus and their endeavour is all going in vain due to this comic spread of fake news; where the civilian has already proclaimed the antidotes of this virus and the preventive measures likely to be taken by the government. In all this chaos the people already have declared the various stages of the lockdown which should rather be announced by government in the first place. The sources of such fact just do one job that is to misguide the people of our nation. The customary man in general should be accused. <br>
                                            • Election: 2019
                                        In India's backdrop, fake news is difficult to constraint. With millions of inhabitants with the access to internet, fake news can emerge out of nowhere. In the context of 2019 elections, 'fake news' is a synonym of 'paid news'. The Election Commissioner has been entitled with the right of debarring the candidate who uses sources as paid and fake news for the propaganda of winning the context. However it's a task for the Commissioner to have an eye for detail and to take action against the unlawful speech- hate speech, bribery for votes, communalism, and cases alike. 
                                        Rather than focusing on the content element of fake news the EC would be better off in trying to unearth who is spending and whether candidates have made adequate declarations. While curbs are placed on candidates’ spending, no such limitations are placed on the spending of political parties. Even if candidate spending were to be tracked, it would still be an uphill task to prove that there was unreported spending on fake news.

                                            • Mob Lynching
                                        
                                        In India, the spread of fake messages on social media has created an unprecedented crisis. Lynch mobs, often prejudice against certain minority communities and incensed by fake news, are taking the lives of innocent while the law and order system grapples with rising violence. In 2018 the spread of false rumours of child abduction and cow slaughter resulted in widespread mob violence and lynching where the accused were beaten or killed. As many as 24 people were killed in mob attacks only in 2018.
                                        
                                         Maharashtra, Jharkhand, Assam, Tamil Nadu, Telangana and Karnataka states have witnessed the worst of mob lynching cases owing to fake news. The situation has become so dangerous that the Supreme court of India has stated that our country has become a “mobocracy” where quick vigilante justice has become the new norm.3

                                        The legal action can be taken against the offenders for spreading false information or rumours which is prejudicial to the interest of people or interest of state though it has limitations posed by the government.

                                        Constitutional provisions:

                                            1. The Constitution of India, under Article 19 (1) (a)4 grants each citizen of India, the freedom of speech and expression5. However, the said Fundamental Right is not absolute and can have reasonable restrictions; like in this routine of pandemic and fake news, it can be restricted in interest of the sovereignty and integrity of India, the security of the State, friendly relations with foreign States, public order, decency or morality, or about contempt of court, defamation or incitement to an offense. Hence, any attempt to suppress the voice of people in a public sphere behind the garb of an Anti-Fake News Bill will lead to a situation of a constitutional violation. Many could claim that it’s conflicting to restrict the right inherent to the citizen. However, as a preventive measure, various State Governments have come up with internet shutdowns.

Section 505(1) of Indian Penal Code, 1860: whoever by making, publishing or circulating any statement, rumour or report which may cause fear or alarm to the public or to any section of the public shall be punished with imprisonment which may extend to three years, or with fine, or with both.6
                                            3. Section 66D of Information Technology Act: whoever, by means for any communication device or computer resource cheats by personating shall be punish with the imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three years and shall also be liable to fine which may extend to one lakh rupees.7
                                            4. Section 54 of the Disaster Management Act, 2005: Whoever makes or circulates a false alarm or warning as to disaster or its severity or magnitude, leading to panic shall be punish with the Imprisonment which may extend to one year or with fine.8
                                        Also, Some people are panicking, and looking to magical cures, and other’s with vested interest are spreading conspiracies against the governments, communities and trying to create racial, communal or religious unrest, the acts which can be prosecuted under section 153/153A of Indian Penal code. Recently, an idea such as linking Aadhaar to social media accounts has been suggested to the Supreme Court of India by the Attorney General.9

                                         <p>
                                        
                                        Since 2018, until now the government exercise in total 252 internet shutdowns in all. The longest shutdown in the history of India commenced on 4th August 2019 when the article 370 of the Indian constitution was abrogated by the parliament of India. This internet shutdown existed for 213 days and ceased on 4th March 2020. This happened to prevent the spreading of fake news, communalism and misinformation10.

                                         <h5 class="text-uppercase">CONCLUSION</h5>

                                        In my suggestion, the source of the predominant facts and news should be limited to one only. This reminds me of the childhood group game of “Chinese Whisper" where the information at the initial stage is accurate and has an existential crisis while reaching the end. It is correctly said that too many cooks spoil the broth. Involvement of too many people in the release of major facts hampers both, the process and the news. 
                                        Based on the analysis and summaries above, I find out that fake news has a deep relationship with social media and politics. A combination of media affordances and systemic trends: the design of social media platforms and search engines, and the intense competitive pressure on professional journalism caused by the digitalization of news and the acceleration of news cycles.
                                        User’s network on social media is segregated. Users add people as friends on social media mainly because they share similar backgrounds or same interests. So what appear on their news feed could be the contents they would love to read and believe. 
                                        Therefore, we can conclude that fake news is one form of dysfunctional hybridity in the hybrid media system. Also the PIL is pending before the Supreme Court which was filed on 24th Apr., 2020 for assistance from the Centre to curb the spread of fake news.11 Through social media, fake news could have extensive influence not only 2019 election, mob lynching, CAA or COVID -19 Pandemic, but also other fields related to our daily life. </p>
