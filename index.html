                                                    <p>
                                                        Rumours are a deadly weapon that affects the morale of the people. But tensions have always been a breeding ground of information operations. A few years ago, ‘fake news’ was a rarely used term but with the civilisation of social media it has put us into a grave position leading us to face fake news. 
                                                        Today, it has become one of the greatest threats to the civilians of our society where the society believes in every rumour on social media platform. These days the manipulation of the facts is just the propaganda of whistleblowers. Both, information and misinformation are at our fingertips. This only means that it is almost as easy to spread fake news as it is to verify it. At present internet is the only nexus between the audience where the world at large itself is an audience and recipients. Thus, social media is often accused of shaping public debate and unfairly engineering people's behaviour and undermining the democratic process instead of nurturing a healthy public sphere. 
                                                        Humans have an essential role in spreading the word. The effortless access to the internet world is both a boon and bane. Every coin has its two sides. The heart of this Article lies in the other side that is the bane of easily accessible social media networks. Rolling out fake news is no trifling act. People at large are overworked and become pretentious by the same cause. ‘Fake news’ has become a global concern since the rise of unpleasant incidents that have challenged the users’ trust in the news, especially through social media. There are no adequate preventive measures taken to curb the spreading of fake news and to hold people accountable for committing it.
                                                        <br>
                                                        Fake news not only turned out to be a curse for the common man, who find it difficult to distinguish from fiction but also for law enforcement agencies. Unlike other countries, the prime distributor of fake news in India is WhatsApp, but not other social networking sites like Facebook or Twitter. It has not only misinformed the users on social media but also triggered violence and barbaric killings around the country. In a country where innocents have been brutally killed by panicked mobs on the basis of rumours of child kidnappers spread on WhatsApp, this seems a justifiable fear. More so when there are a number of websites pretending to be news websites that peddle all sorts of hateful, communal propaganda with the tacit blessing of the ruling dispensation. According to a Microsoft report, Indian internet users are more likely to have been subjected to fake news than any others.

                                                    <p>
                                                        
                                                        • Citizenship amendment act (CAA)
                                                        One huge instance of outspreading of fake news before the COVID-19 cause came into the scene was the CAA (Citizenship Amendment Act)1 where the government was accused of establishing “Hindutva” over the nation. Uninformed and poorly literate population of the country demeaned the Act summoning it of being inaugurated against the Islamic Believers. The news channels also played a vital role in portrayal of communalism. The common unlearned man could not only grasp the language but also exhibited utter confusion led to spreading of fake news. Fake news doesn’t evolve intentionally always. Sometimes misconstruction of thoughts and ideas conveyed under common understanding configure fake news. Looking back at the time of debates involving CAA, a lot of communal riots arose over the nation. <br>
                                                        • COVID 19 (Corona)
                                                        Glancing at the current time, the common man already started declaring certain facts and the remedial actions speculated to be taken under the name of the government. All of this focuses on leading to rolling out of misinformation and immediately forming an opinion in the minds of civilians. For an instance, when LOCKDOWN: 1 ended, hundreds of labourers flocked to the stations hoping for the trains to commence the journeys taking them back to their hometown. 
                                                        While dealing with the set of circumstances, the Supreme Court of India held that the migration of large number of labourers working in the cities was triggered by panic created by fake news that the lock down would continue for more than three months2. Such panic caused migration and untold suffering to those who believed and acted on such fake news. In fact, some of the labourers have lost their lives while walking for hundreds of miles on foot. It is therefore not possible for us to overlook this menace of fake news either by electronic, print or social media. 
                                                        Amidst the pandemic of the corona virus, our nation is facing internal pandemic - fake news. The news channels actively blamed the Muslim community for the spread which later led to the repercussions on them apologizing for spreading hate against the community. The public health departments also face grave challenges in dealing with the spread of fake news. The public health department has spent sleepless night and struggling days to in order to curb this virus and their endeavour is all going in vain due to this comic spread of fake news; where the civilian has already proclaimed the antidotes of this virus and the preventive measures likely to be taken by the government. In all this chaos the people already have declared the various stages of the lockdown which should rather be announced by government in the first place. The sources of such fact just do one job that is to misguide the people of our nation. The customary man in general should be accused. <br>
                                                        • Election: 2019
                                                        In India's backdrop, fake news is difficult to constraint. With millions of inhabitants with the access to internet, fake news can emerge out of nowhere. In the context of 2019 elections, 'fake news' is a synonym of 'paid news'. The Election Commissioner has been entitled with the right of debarring the candidate who uses sources as paid and fake news for the propaganda of winning the context. However it's a task for the Commissioner to have an eye for detail and to take action against the unlawful speech- hate speech, bribery for votes, communalism, and cases alike. 
                                                        Rather than focusing on the content element of fake news the EC would be better off in trying to unearth who is spending and whether candidates have made adequate declarations. While curbs are placed on candidates’ spending, no such limitations are placed on the spending of political parties. Even if candidate spending were to be tracked, it would still be an uphill task to prove that there was unreported spending on fake news.

                                                        • Mob Lynching
                                                        
                                                        In India, the spread of fake messages on social media has created an unprecedented crisis. Lynch mobs, often prejudice against certain minority communities and incensed by fake news, are taking the lives of innocent while the law and order system grapples with rising violence. In 2018 the spread of false rumours of child abduction and cow slaughter resulted in widespread mob violence and lynching where the accused were beaten or killed. As many as 24 people were killed in mob attacks only in 2018.
                                                        
                                                        Maharashtra, Jharkhand, Assam, Tamil Nadu, Telangana and Karnataka states have witnessed the worst of mob lynching cases owing to fake news. The situation has become so dangerous that the Supreme court of India has stated that our country has become a “mobocracy” where quick vigilante justice has become the new norm.3

                                                        The legal action can be taken against the offenders for spreading false information or rumours which is prejudicial to the interest of people or interest of state though it has limitations posed by the government.

                                                        Constitutional provisions:
                                                        <br>
                                                        1. The Constitution of India, under Article 19 (1) (a)4 grants each citizen of India, the freedom of speech and expression5. However, the said Fundamental Right is not absolute and can have reasonable restrictions; like in this routine of pandemic and fake news, it can be restricted in interest of the sovereignty and integrity of India, the security of the State, friendly relations with foreign States, public order, decency or morality, or about contempt of court, defamation or incitement to an offense. Hence, any attempt to suppress the voice of people in a public sphere behind the garb of an Anti-Fake News Bill will lead to a situation of a constitutional violation. Many could claim that it’s conflicting to restrict the right inherent to the citizen. However, as a preventive measure, various State Governments have come up with internet shutdowns. 
                                                        
                                                        2. Section 505(1) of Indian Penal Code, 1860: whoever by making, publishing or circulating any statement, rumour or report which may cause fear or alarm to the public or to any section of the public shall be punished with imprisonment which may extend to three years, or with fine, or with both.6
                                                        3. Section 66D of Information Technology Act: whoever, by means for any communication device or computer resource cheats by personating shall be punish with the imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three years and shall also be liable to fine which may extend to one lakh rupees.7
                                                        4. Section 54 of the Disaster Management Act, 2005: Whoever makes or circulates a false alarm or warning as to disaster or its severity or magnitude, leading to panic shall be punish with the Imprisonment which may extend to one year or with fine.8
                                                        Also, Some people are panicking, and looking to magical cures, and other’s with vested interest are spreading conspiracies against the governments, communities and trying to create racial, communal or religious unrest, the acts which can be prosecuted under section 153/153A of Indian Penal code. Recently, an idea such as linking Aadhaar to social media accounts has been suggested to the Supreme Court of India by the Attorney General.9

This internet shutdown existed for 213 days and ceased on 4th March 2020. This happened to prevent the spreading of fake news, communalism and misinformation10.

                                                        In my suggestion, the source of the predominant facts and news should be limited to one only. This reminds me of the childhood group game of “Chinese Whisper" where the information at the initial stage is accurate and has an existential crisis while reaching the end. It is correctly said that too many cooks spoil the broth. Involvement of too many people in the release of major facts hampers both, the process and the news. 
                                                        Based on the analysis and summaries above, I find out that fake news has a deep relationship with social media and politics. A combination of media affordances and systemic trends: the design of social media platforms and search engines, and the intense competitive pressure on professional journalism caused by the digitalization of news and the acceleration of news cycles.
                                                        User’s network on social media is segregated. Users add people as friends on social media mainly because they share similar backgrounds or same interests. So what appear on their news feed could be the contents they would love to read and believe. 
                                                        Therefore, we can conclude that fake news is one form of dysfunctional hybridity in the hybrid media system. Also the PIL is pending before the Supreme Court which was filed on 24th Apr., 2020 for assistance from the Centre to curb the spread of fake news.11 Through social media, fake news could have extensive influence not only 2019 election, mob lynching, CAA or COVID -19 Pandemic, but also other fields related to our daily life. </p>

                                                    <p>
                                                        The basic efforts are assured to protect the essential human rights of all Indian people and are put to bear by the Judiciary, due to a few restrictions. Ability to Uniformity is one such critical privilege. As the essay speaks for itself that when it comes to justice all is handled the same. The statute calls for property to be represented regardless of all factors.
                                                        For a rule-based country like India, or any modern society regulation for that matter, plays a very critical role. For India, moving in with various values, this article takes us under the massive umbrella of equity and interest. Subsequently, Article 14 should be regarded as the foundation of our structure; showing that no stone should be swept up unturned; that no person with profit should be able to stand on the property of someone with fewer benefits. Policy is one and the same for everyone.
                                                        
                                                    </p>
                                                    <h5 class="text-uppercase">MEANING AND ORIGIN</h5>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Article 14 is a directive to the state that it shall not deny Equal protection of law and Equality before the law to whosoever within the geographical boundaries of India. Article 14 combines two very important aspects. First one is ‘Rule of Law’, a British Doctrine which was set forth by Prof. Dicey and ‘Equal Protection of the Laws’, which comes from Clause 14th from the US Constitution putting intensity and strength in the article which is there to ensure equality in a country of millions. But the Supreme Court had to at times lessen this vigor of article 14 so as to ensure that the welfare programs can operate without hurdles.1
                                                    </p>
                                                    <h5 class="text-uppercase">LATEST ASPECTS OF ARTICLE 14</h5>
                                                    
                                                    <p>  
                                                        With time, Article 14 evolved and a new dimension was added in it in the very famous E.P Royappa vs. State of Tamil Nadu and Anr., in which it was held that Article 14 is a notion that is actively changing. At the same time, it is no way possible that it can be damaged, and can be kept inside limited boundaries of any practice or concepts. Irrationality and impartiality are poles apart as former emphasizes on a system deprived of freedom; and the latter emphasizes on liberty and fairness. Any legislation that does not follow the concept of reasonableness can be called bureaucratically and constitutionally against the Article of Equality. 
                                                    </p>

                                                        Uncertainty followed it from managing the British exhibition of justice. This means that no man is above the law and is subject to the authority of standard courts by each person, everything is his rank or condones. "With us" Dicey wrote “every official from the prime minister down to constable or a collector of taxes is under the same responsibility for every act done without legal justification as any other citizen". Prof. Dicey gave 3 meanings of the rule of law-
                                                        1. Absence of arbitrary power or supremacy of the law.
                                                        2. Equality before the law
                                                        3. The constitution is the result of the ordinary law of the land. 
                                                        • The third aspect doesn't apply to the Indian constitution
                                                    </p>
                                                    <h5 class="text-uppercase">EQUALITY BEFORE LAW AND ABSOLUTE EQUALITY</h5>
                                                    <p>
                                                        The principle of uniformity does not establish cruel supreme equilibrium for human beings which is biologically unimaginable. Dr Jennings explains it this way: 
                                                        “Equality before the law means that among equals the law should be equal and should be equally administered, that like should be treated alike. The freedom to sue and be charged, punished and prosecuted over the same form of crime would be the same for all people of complete age and awareness without distinctions of ethnicity, faith, education, socioeconomic class or political sophistication”.</p>

                                                        <p>
                                                            Rule of law embodied in Article 14 is the ‘Basic Feature’ of the Indian constitution and hence, it cannot be destroyed by any amendment under Article 368 of the Indian Constitution.
                                                            The words ‘Any Person' in Article 14 of the Indian Constitution denotes that the guarantee of the equal protection of laws is available to any person which includes any company or association or body of individuals. The protection of Article 14 extends to both citizens and non-citizens and to natural persons as well as legal persons.   
                                                        </p>

                                                            However, there are certain exceptions to this. Article 359 which suspends the enforcement of fundamental rights as the time of emergency also suspends Article 14. Article 361 provides that the President of India and the Governors of the States cannot face any legal order at the time when they are performing some official work under their power. They are immune from court cases except in some situations. As per Article 105 and Article 194, the MLAs and MPs charged with the case of defamation when they are inside the parliament retains actions inside the Legislative Assembly and Parliament. The officers arriving from different counties to India cannot be prosecuted.   
                                                        </p>

                                                            The changing interests of different groups of people also need partitioned care which Article 14 precludes is the legislation of course but it does not exclude the definition that is sensible. In any case, the classification must not be "arbitrary, false or deceptive," but must be based on a few real and relevant specifics with a reasonable and responsive relation to the grievance that the law aims to achieve.
                                                            Class legislation is that which allows an unacceptable division by offering clear advantages to a class of people, self-assuredly selected from a wide number of citizens, all of whom are in the same relation to the advantage and that no sensible criterion or difference can be made between them and the citizens not so favored, legitimizing the integration of one and the other.

                                                            1. Intelligible differentia distinction must be made
                                                            2. The disparity must have a logical connection to the purpose which the act aims to accomplish.
                                                            • A NEXUS must be formed between the classification principle and the complaint of the act creating the classification.
                                                            Therefore, as reservation for backward classes and backward caste is valid on the grounds of reasonable classification, so it is not violating Article 14 of the Indian Constitution.

                                                            The SC held that Article 14 doesn't restrict the word ‘person' and its application only to male or female and Hijras/Transgender persons who are neither Male nor Female fall within the expression ‘person'. They are entitled to legal protection of laws in all spheres of state activity including employment, health care, education as well as equal civil citizenship rights, as enjoyed by any other citizen of this country.

                                                        <p>Finally, it is very important to recognize that the decision of the courts will be focused on holding in check both the traditional and the modern orthodoxy, without overlooking the critique of both doctrines. The Intelligible Differentia Theory will be promoted. The introduction and extension of Article 14 has widened the breadth step by stage, the nexus check and the principle of non-arbitrariness are the simplest illustration of that. Article 14 is a huge principle that needs to be held current with the increasing conditions of civilization and the appropriate justice procedure. Rick Riordan 's quotation correctly suits in here, "Fairness doesn't mean everybody is having the same. Fairness ensures everybody get what they need”.</p>

                                                    <p>
                                                        When independent India was making the constitution, they already had a lot of nations as example which adopted the concept of Democracy and Humanitarian. So, the founding fathers of the constitution endeavored to formulate something which reflects multiple things like Rights of Minority, Principles of UDHR etc. and after the discussion of many days, the very idea of fundamental rights was borrowed from America’s Bill of Rights.
                                                        Fundamental Rights are those rights which are essential for every human being to live a life in dignified manner and it also helps in overall development of an individual. These rights are enshrined in Part III (Article 12-Article 35) of Indian Constitution.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <h6 class="text-uppercase">Article 12 and Article 13 of Indian constitution</h6>
                                                    <p>
                                                        As per Article 12 of the constitution, State includes the Government and Parliament of India and the Government and the Legislature of each of the States and all local or other authorities within the territory of India or under the control of the Government of India. This definition of the state is only applicable to Part III and Part IV of the Constitution and does not extend to the other provisions of the constitution. In the case of Electricity Board, Rajasthan v. Mohan Lal it was held that the expression ‘other authorities’ includes all authorities created by the Constitution or statute to whom the powers are conferred by the law. It was also seen that it was not necessary that the statutory authority should be engaged in performing governmental or sovereign function.
                                                        Article 13 of the Constitution deals with ‘Laws’ that are inconsistent with Fundamental Rights guaranteed to the Citizens. This is one of the most important articles and crux of why Fundamental Rights are an integral part of our Constitution. This is that Article that makes Fundamental Rights justiciable and hence, enforceable in courts of law.
                                                        
                                                    </p>
                                                    <h5 class="text-uppercase">ARTICLE 13-LAWS IN DEROGATION WITH FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS WILL BE VOID</h5>
                                                    <p>  
                                                        Article 13(1) deals with pre constitution laws, which means the laws which existed before the Constitution of India came into existence, and, if such laws are against fundamental rights they shall become invalid now the extent to which they shall remain invalid shall be determined by the application of two doctrines viz. Doctrine of Severability / Separability and Doctrine of Eclipse.
                                                        <br>
                                                        Doctrine of Severability/Separability, is a guardian of our fundamental rights. Suppose, if any of the provisions in an act/statue is contrary to our fundamental rights then that provision only would consider being void and it is not the whole act that becomes void. The same can be explained by a very important case related to this doctrine A.K. Gopalan v. State of Madras (AIR 1950 SC 27). In this case, the Section 14 of Prevention Detention Act was challenged. According to Section 14, if any person is detained under this respective act, he cannot disclose grounds of detention in the court. So, Section 14 was against the fundamental rights, if you apply doctrine of severability here and filter out this act, only Section 14 of the Act was not respecting fundamental rights. So, according to doctrine, if we filter our Prevention Detention Act only the Section 14 is inconsistent with fundamental right. So, we will minus only this provision (Section 14) from the act, and remaining act shall be valid.
                                                        <br>
                                                        The Doctrine of Eclipse (means to hide) was lightened up by Supreme Court in the case of Bhikhaji v. State of Madhya Pradesh (AIR 1955 SC 781). The Supreme Court in this case held that any law which is inconsistent with fundamental rights is not invalid or dead totally but it becomes inoperative and it is over shadowed by fundamental rights (i.e. fundamental rights should prevail over such law which is inconsistent) and when the inconsistency is removed by constitutional amendment from the relevant fundamental rights, then the eclipse vanishes and the entire law becomes valid.
                                                        <br>
                                                        Further, Article 13(2) talks about post constitutional laws, meaning the laws that came into existence after Indian Constitution, where the state is prohibited to make any such laws which abridges the rights of citizens. Therefore, if there is any such law which violates Fundamental Rights then it becomes void ab initio. Moreover, any law made in the contravention of this clause shall, to the extent of the contravention be void.
                                                        <br>
                                                        Article 13(3) of the Constitution gives the overview of the term 'LAW'. Every law which affects the legal rights of the citizens will be consider as law under article 13(3) for example Bye-laws, regulations, customs, etc. but does not include personal laws. 
                                                        Now the question aroused that can Parliament make amendments under an act which are against the Fundamental Rights?
                                                        In Shankari Prasad v. Union Of India (AIR 1951 SC458) it was held that ‘Law’ in Article 13 is ordinary law made under the legislative powers and therefore Parliament, under Article 368, has the power to amend any part of the constitution including fundamental rights. The Court gave the same ruling in Sajjan Singh v. State of Rajasthan.
                                                        But in the case of Golaknath v. State of Punjab (AIR 1967 SC 1643), the Supreme Court overruled its earlier decision and, it was held that Parliament has no power to amend Part III of the constitution. After this case Parliament made the 24th Constitutional Amendment Act, 1971 in which Article 13(4) was included which meant that any amendment made under Article 368 cannot be challenged under Article 13.
                                                        Further, in the case of Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerela (AIR 1973 SC 146), the Supreme Court reviewed its Golaknath Case decision and was held that Parliament could amend any part of the Constitution so long as it did not alter or amend ‘the basic structure or essential features of the Constitution.’

                                                        Uncertainty followed it from managing the British exhibition of justice. This means that no man is above the law and is subject to the authority of standard courts by each person, everything is his rank or condones. "With us" Dicey wrote “every official from the prime minister down to constable or a collector of taxes is under the same responsibility for every act done without legal justification as any other citizen". Prof. Dicey gave 3 meanings of the rule of law-
                                                        1. Absence of arbitrary power or supremacy of the law.
                                                        2. Equality before the law
                                                        3. The constitution is the result of the ordinary law of the land. 
                                                        • The third aspect doesn't apply to the Indian constitution

                                                    <h5 class="text-uppercase">CONCLUSION</h5>
                                                    <p>Article 13 is the most debatable issue of our constitutional history. Basically, the need for this article in our constitution was for the citizens so that they can protect their fundamental rights (Guaranteed under Part III of Constitution) against the state. The constitution makers were aware that the government often finds them inconvenient in their functioning. Therefore, to stop the government from manipulating these Fundamental rights, this Article was inserted.</p>

                                                    <p> By the word ‘Preamble’ itself, one can understand that it is the introductory part of any statue or deed which states the purpose, aims and justification. It sets the tone of the constitution.  It can also be known as the Blueprint of any act.  Basically, the Preamble of India, interprets, guides and provide sources of the constitution, its nature and the objectives. It shortly covers all the elements of the constitution. If one needs to know the constitution of the country, they can simply reach out to the preamble of it. The ideals of the preamble were laid down by Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, which was later adopted by the constitution. By the word, ‘By The People, For The People & Of The People’ it clearly means that, it is the people who choose the government and it is made up of people who emerge and rise to the position from the common people. Basically it says that the government comprises of common people who were chosen and equally elected by the common people. Preamble is an essential component of a constitution. It comprises of a summary or essence of the constitution. The basic idea behind framing the preamble was that it conforms to norms and ideals of the constitution and express the philosophy and guidance of the maker in few words.</p>

                                                        Initially, the preamble was drafted by SH.B.N. Rau in his memorandum of May 30, 1947, & was later reproduced in the draft on October 7, 1947. The Preamble of India is based upon the ‘Objective Resolution’ which was introduced by Jawaharlal Nehru in the Constituent Assembly on December 13, 1946 and later was enacted and forced as a resolution on January 22, 1947.  The Original Preamble of India constituted and declared the country into ‘Sovereign, Democratic and Republic’.  During the time of the National Emergency our constitution was modified and later amended, with the 42nd Constitutional Amendment, 1976, which is also popularly known as ‘MINI CONSTITUTION’. Along with the amendment two new concepts ‘Socialist and Secular’ were added making it into “Sovereign Socialist Secular Democratic & Republic”. 
                                                        Its ideology and objective includes SOVEREIGN SOCIALIST SECULAR DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC and to secure all its citizens.

In the case of Electricity Board, Rajasthan v. Mohan Lal it was held that the expression ‘other authorities’ includes all authorities created by the Constitution or statute to whom the powers are conferred by the law. It was also seen that it was not necessary that the statutory authority should be engaged in performing governmental or sovereign function.
                                                        Article 13 of the Constitution deals with ‘Laws’ that are inconsistent with Fundamental Rights guaranteed to the Citizens. This is one of the most important articles and crux of why Fundamental Rights are an integral part of our Constitution. This is that Article that makes Fundamental Rights justiciable and hence, enforceable in courts of law.

                                                        We all are aware that India and United States are the two largest democracies in the world. These two nations are also constitutional republics, which are bound by a written constitution. The Preamble of the Constitution of United States and the Constitution India also starts with “We the people” which moves in the Preamble of Constitution. However, the attitude of the general public and the political establishment towards the constitution are different in the US and India. The American constitution is just 4,543 words long, whereas the Indian constitution has 1, 45,000 words. The US preamble serves as an introduction and it does not assign the powers to the federal government, nor does it provide specific limitation on government actions. Whereas the Indian preamble is considered as the significant part of the Indian constitution which mainly focusing on the objectives of the Indian constitution. The Fundamental Rights in India are vast than in the United States. The Indian Constitution has eleven articles which discuss about the languages. In contrast, the American constitution does not talk about languages at all. The US has no ‘Official’ or ‘National’ language. American federation is based on agreement between the States whereas Indian Federation is not based on agreement which is between the States. India has Single Citizenship for both the States and Union. Whereas in the US there is a dual citizenship, that is the Federal and State Citizenship.

                                                    <p>The preamble is an introductory part of the constitution. Preamble highlights the main objectives and its adoption and nature. Constitution is the Supreme law of India. The document lays down the political, procedure, powers and duties of the Government and sets out Fundamental Rights, Directive Principles of State Policies and Duties of all the citizens. In the Constitution, it states how the government shall run, distribution of powers among the Legislative, Executive and Judiciary. Preamble highlights the ideals of the constitution which aims at achieving social, economic, and political justice. It states the importance of liberty of thought and maintains the dignity of an individual and the nation. We can change the preamble by amendment procedure given in constitution, but we cannot change the basic structure of the constitution. </p>

                                                        The utmost important question arises is whether preamble is a part of constitution or not? There were several arguments arrived upon it. The most two prominent cases which discuss this question are: <br>
                                                        1. Beruberi Case, 1960: Under this case, the Supreme Court has declared that preamble cannot be a part of Constitution. And also it is not enforceable in a Court of Law. It does not able to prohibit the explicit powers which are illustrated in constitution.
                                                        <br>
                                                        2. Kesavananda Bharti Case, 1973: It was the most landmark case which held with a bench of 13 judges of the Supreme Court hearing the writ petition. It changed the previous decision of the Court. Under this, the Supreme Court has announced that preamble is a very pat of the Constitution. And it can be subjected to amend under the Article 368 of the Constitution of India. Parliament has certain power only to amend the Constitution but the basic structure of the Constitution cannot be amended.  Under Article 368 of Constitution, gives power to form formal amendments and empowers parliament to form amends by the mean of addition, variation or modification consistent with the procedure established by Law.

                                                    <p>By far we can say, Preamble is an ultimate source of Constitution. And without Preamble it would be very difficult to understand the whole Constitution by large. Preamble highlights the very basic structure and nature of Constitution, briefly. It focuses mainly on basic fundamental values and ideologies which were encrypted and drafted by the Founding Fathers. It serves as a manual to the Constitution. Hence, it is a basic and necessary part of Constitution. Several phenomena of the Constitution have been adopted from various countries. The preamble focuses that the people of India have adopted, enacted and gave to themselves the Constitution on the 26th day of November, 1949 but the date of commencement was fixed to the 26th day of January, 1950. Preamble has a pivotal role in stating the Constitution and reflecting the spirit of Constitution to form and nourish the country into Sovereign, Socialist, Secular, Democratic, Republic, Justice, Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity among its members.</p>

                                                        Our Constitution says that, Equality Before Law, that is, the State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the law within the territory of India. If, the functionaries of the law become law-breakers, it is bound to breed contempt for the law and encourage lawlessness. 
Police, the most important organisation of the society, are considered as a representative of the government. Police brutality is legally defined as an offence which is violation of civil rights of an individual. Police brutality means use of excessive and unnecessary force by police officers against public. Such police brutality results in lack of trust towards policemen. Police brutality is legally defined as an offence which is violation of civil rights of an individual. Police brutality can be of various types like, 
<br>
    • False arrest and wrong imprisonment <br>
    • Sexual harassment <br>
    • Racial discrimination <br>
    • Wrongful search and seizure <br>
Police brutality infringes the Articles 20, 21 and 22 of Indian Constitution.  
Article 20 of the Indian Constitution provides for Protection In Respect Of Conviction Of Offences.
Article 20, provides three basic guarantees. <br> They are as follows: <br>
1. Protection against ex post facto laws. <br>
2. Protection against double jeopardy. <br>
3. Protection against self-incrimination.  <br>
Article 22, gives protection to arrested person against arrest and detention in certain cases which within its ambit contains very valuable element of natural justice. Article 22 (1) and (2) provides the following four fundamental rights upon a person who has been arrested: <br>
1. Right to be informed, as soon as may be, of the grounds for such arrest.
2. Right to consult and to be defended by a legal practitioner of his choice.
3. Right to be produced before the nearest magistrate within 24 hours of his arrest.
4. Right not to be detained in custody beyond the period of 24 hours without the authority of the magistrate.

                                                        Police brutality is not new in this modern world. It is a societal issue that was noted since industrial revolution in the year 1870's when law enforcement would physically harm the workers. The term ‘Police Brutality’ was used for the first time in the year 1872 in the American press, when the tribunal of Chicago reported the beating of a civilian under arrest at the Harrison street police station. Records suggest that Labour strikes were the first large-scale incidents of police brutality in the United States, including events like the Great Railroad Strike of the year 1877, the Pullman Strike of the year 1894, the Lawrence textile strike of the year 1912, the Ludlow massacre of the year 1914, the Great Steel Strike of the year 1919. In India, the Jallianwala Bagh Massacre incident took place on 13th of July, 1919, where police killed atleast 400 people and injured over 1500 people. It was the case of Police Brutality. In the movement of 1960's the police used high power water guns on the civilians and sometimes, attack was made on the public with the help of Police dogs.

                                                        According to the comparative study of police brutality in India and America, police brutality rate of America in 2019:
1,004 people were shot and killed by police whereas the mapping police violence project counted 1,098 killed. Since the 20th century, there have been many public, private and community efforts to combat police corruption and brutality. Like America, India too has a problem of excessive police brutality. According to the status of policing in India report, 2019, 70 police stations across 20 states didn't have wireless communication, 214 had no access to telephone, 240 were without vehicles. However, quiet similar to the racial bias of US police, Indian police often place a partisan role during communal riots, which is one reason such riots continue to take place. As per the data from the National Crime Records Bureau, 1,727 people died in police custody during the time period between 2001 and 2018. However, just 26 policemen were convicted of custodial violence during the same period.

                                                    <p> Police officers are given freedom of action, thoughts, etc. in performing their duties.  They are given a great deal of as they are expected to protect the public and confront violent individuals, they can legally use physical, and even deadly force under certain circumstances. Police officers are one who should reform the law and not break it. Legal systems exists for a reason.  If the saviour of the law itself, are the destructor of the rule, there will definitely be contempt, rage, disappointment, misery among the citizens towards the police. Police brutality comes under Police corruption, which is consider to be a misconduct. Though police brutality is considered as a severe offence but still, there are many cases where the complaint of an individual does not even reach to the investigation stage. A police officers must protect their citizens and should not brutality beat them.</p>

                                                        In the 21st century lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender are openly coming up in society and demanding their rights. In India, LGBT community have limited rights and also they face social problems from non-LGBT persons. Article 15 of the Indian Constitution states, Prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth.
                                                        <br>
                                                        (1) The State shall not discriminate against any citizen on grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex, place of birth or any of them.

                                                    Transgender people are allowed to change their legal gender as per post-sex reassignment surgery under legislation passed in 2019. Transgender people got their rights after the Supreme Court of India gave judgment on Section 377 where, the Supreme Court stated that Section 377 is unconstitutional as it violates the Fundamental Rights as per Article 14 of the Indian Constitution which states Equality Before Law. It is a landmark decision for LGBT community and their rights since the Country’s independence.

                                                    <p>
                                                        India has considered third gender population as neither male or female. They are called as Hijras in Indian Society. Hijras were legally granted voting rights in 1994. On the 15th of April, 2014, the Supreme Court of India considered transgender community as socially and economically backward class. <br>
In 2013, transgender activist S. Swapna and Gopi Shankar Madurai started protest and demanded reservation for LGBTQ community to permit alternate genders to appear for examination such as UPSC, SSC, and Bank exams, Also Swapna is the first transgender person who cleared TNPSC Group IV exams. <br>
In the case of Navtej Singh Johar vs. Union of India, the Supreme Court asserted that the Indian Constitution bans discrimination based on sexual category. <br>
Before 2018, LGBTQ community were banned in armed forces but Jagdambika Pal introduced the bill in parliament to amend the Army Qct 1950, Navy act 1957, Air Force Act 1950  that would allow LGBT community to serve Nation through Army.

                                                    <p>
                                                        The first national gay rights organization the Mattachine society was formed in 1951 was created by Harry Hay. The first lesbian rights organization in the US was founded in 1955.The daughters of Bilitis was founded in San Francisco California by activist couple Del Martin and Philips Lyon. From about 1988, activists began to use the initialism LGBTQ in United States. Not until the 1990s within the movement did gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people gain equal respect. This spurred some organizations to adopt new names as the GLBT Historical society did in 1999. The best known case of homosexuality in Ancient Egypt is that of the two high officials Nyankh – khnum and Khnum – hotep. Both men lived and served under Pharaoh Niuserre during the 5th dynasty.
The gay rights movement saw some early progress in the 1960s. In 1961 Illinois became the first state to do away with its anti-sodomy laws, effectively decriminalizing homosexuality and a local TV station in California aired the first documentary about homosexuality call the rejected. The month of June was chosen for LGBTQ Pride month to commemorate the Stonewall riots which occurred at the end of the June 1969. As a result, many pride events are held during this month to recognize the impact of LGBTQ people have had in the world. LGBTQ OR GLBT is an intialism that stands for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender. In use since the 1990s the term is an adaption of the Intialism LGBTQ which was used to replace the term gay in reference to the LGBT community beginning in the mid – to – late 1980s.As in 2020, LGBTQ History Month is a month-long celebration that is specific to Hungary, the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Brazil, Greenland, and the city of Berlin. In the United States, Canada, and Australia, it is celebrated in October to coincide with National Coming Out Day on 11 October.

                                                    <p>
                                                        LGBTQ history dates back to the first recorded instances of same sex love and sexuality of ancient civilizations involving the history of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender(LGBTQ) people and cultures around the world. What survives after many centuries of persecution – resulting in shame, suppression, and secrecy has only in more recent decades been pursued and interwoven into more mainstream historical narratives. Rights affecting lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender LGBTQ people vary greatly by country or jurisdiction compassing everything from the legal recognition of same sex marriage to the death penalty for homosexuality. Notably as of 2020, 29 countries recognize same-sex marriage they are Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, brazil, Canada, costa Rica, Denmark, Ecuador, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Malta, Mexico, the United states, and Uruguay. By contrast, not counting non-state actors and extrajudicial killings, only one country is believed to impose the death penalty on consensual same-sex sexual acts: Iran. The death penalty is on the books but, as far as is known, not enforced in Afghanistan, Brunei, Mauritania, Nigeria (in the northern third of the country), Saudi Arabia and Somalia (in the autonomous Jubaland region). Sudan rescinded its unenforced death penalty for anal sex (hetero- or homosexual) in 2020. 15 countries have stoning on the books as a penalty for adultery, which would include gay sex, but this is only enforced by the legal authorities in Iran. In 2011 the United nations Human Rights Council passed its first resolution recognizing LGBT Rights following which the office of the united nations High Commissioner for Human Rights issued a report documenting violations of the LGBTQ People including hate crimes, criminalization of homosexual activity, and discrimination. Following the issuance of the report, the United Nations urged all countries which had not yet done so to enact laws protecting basic LGBTQ rights.

                                                    <p> 
                                                        Juvenile law is a system of law that is intended to protect and promote the human rights of all
young people. It is a branch of law that deals with minor or underaged persons who have been
accused of offenses or who are neglected or abandoned by their parents or guardians. The fact is,
it is more concerned with the rehabilitation of charges then adult criminal justice in the context
of a juvenile who is accused of offenses which are termed in law as ‘Juvenile’ conflicts with the
law. There are international standards that exist and these standards emphasize the importance of
both prevention as well as rehabilitation. International standards recognize that &quot;the right of
every child alleged as, accused of, or recognized as having infringed the penal law to be treated
in a manner consistent with the promotion of the child&#39;s sense of dignity and worth.&quot;
                                                    </p>
                                                    <h5 class="text-uppercase">who is a juvenile</h5>
                                                    <p>
                                                        A child who has not attained a certain age, at which, like an adult, under the law of the land, can be held liable for his criminal acts.
                                                        The term juvenile justice emerged from the Latin words &#39;Juvenis&#39;, which means &#39;young&#39;. Hence, a juvenile justice system is one that is specially established for the young.
                                                        As per the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act 2015, the term &#39;Juvenile&#39; refers to a child below the age of 18 years. <br>
                                                    <h5 class="text-uppercase">Need for Separate Criminal Justice for Juveniles</h5>
                                                    <p>
                                                        It is a fundamental principle in law that if unequals are brought on one platform and treated in
the same manner, that would result in inequality, not equality. Thus, children are differently
situated from adults. They are one of the most vulnerable section of the society and are victims
of exploitation and abuse by parents, guardians, and the society at large.
Hence, they require a humane approach, instead of a law and order approach or a retributive
approach to justice.                  
                                                    </p>
                                                    <h5 class="text-uppercase">Juvenile Delinquency</h5>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Juvenile delinquents are those who have not attained the age of adulthood as per the law of the
land, and have yet, acted in a manner that is prohibited by law. Such prohibited behaviour largely
consists of acts that would be termed as offenses under criminal law when committed by adults.
Since a child is a part of society, social context around him/her is bound to have an effect on
child behaviour and attitude, poverty, unemployment, exposer to and experience violence abuse
inequalities, and changing values are bound to impact children and their behaviour.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <h5 class="text-uppercase">Juvenile justice policy in India is largely governed by the constitutional
                                                        mandate given under Article 15:</h5>
                                                    <p>
                                                        The policy is also founded on constitutional guarantees such as the Right to Equality, Protection
of Life and Personal Liberty and the Right against Exploitation (enshrined in Articles 14, 15, 16,
21, 23 and 24.
The Indian constitution emphasizes the duty of the state to prevent exploitation of children and to
promote children welfare.
                                                    </p>
                    
                                                    <h5 class="text-uppercase">Evolution of the Act</h5>
                                                    <p> So, the juvenile justice policy in India is not only based on the Constitution of India but also,
                                                        influenced by international standards and jurisprudence. The first act or the legislation on
                                                        juvenile justice in India came in 1850 known as the Apprentice Act, 1850 which said that
                                                        children between the ages of 10-18 years convicted in courts were to be provided training as a
                                                        part of their rehabilitation process. This act was substituted by the Reformatory Schools Act,
                                                        1897 which, subsequently provided that children up to the age of 15 years may be sent to the
                                                        Reformatory Cell, and later the Juvenile Justice Act, 1986 provided a uniform mechanism of
                                                        Juvenile Justice. This act was replaced by the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection) Act, 2000.
                                                        In the case of Nirbhaya also known as the Delhi Gang Rape case which happened on the 16 th of
                                                        December 2012 where, a juvenile was also accused of gang rape but was treated under the
                                                        provisions of the juvenile justice act as juvenile even though the crime was heinous. This, was
                                                        the major drawback that even the crime was heinous the juvenile was treated under that act and
                                                        therefore, after the protest the bill was passed by the Rajya Sabha known as Juvenile Justice Bill
                                                        2014 and the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2000 was replaced in 2015
                                                        by a new law – Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015.</p>

                                                                Juveniles, nowadays are actively committing crimes which are heinous like murder, rape, etc.
                                                                and the law is insufficient for giving punishment to the juveniles according to the crime
                                                                committed by them. Age must not only be the criteria to punish the offenders. It should be on the

                                                        study and plan about future career. Everyone wishes that their childhood should be a memorable one with lots of good memories. But, it is sad to know that many children are not able to live their childhood phase. Many of them are forced by their family or guardian for child marriage.

                                                </p>Child marriage, means a marriage whether be a formal or an informal marriage of child below
                                                the age of 18 years. Mostly, the child marriage occurs of a young girl, that is, of a girl under age
                                                of 18 years to an older man or say a boy. Child marriage is still practiced in many parts of the
                                                world, and affects girls and women from different communities.</p>
                                                <p>As compared to the world, about more than 40% of    child marriage takes place in India, even
                                                    though 18 years is the legal age of marriage. About 27% of girls in India are married before 18
                                                    years of age and 7% are married before 15 years of age. According to UNICEF, India has the
                                                    highest number of child brides in the world, that is, 15,509,000. Child marriage is banned in
                                                    India and the laws are made very stringent against child marriage, but still such customs continue

                                                    An act to restrain the solemnization of child marriage was enacted. The act came into force on
                                                    the 1 st day of April, 1930 and is named as Child Marriage Restraint Act, 1929.</p>

                                                        The reason behind child marriages is, often gender inequality and the belief that girls and women overall are an inferior and dependent section of the society. But, in India, child marriage is also driven by many other reasons.</p>
                                                        Some of them are as follows:

                                                    <p>
                                                        In Ancient Greece, early marriage and motherhood for girls was encouraged. Even, boys were
excepted to marry in their early age. In Ancient Rome, boys were married above the age of 14
years and girls above 12 years.
Child marriage was outlawed in 1929. Under Indian law during the British Colonial times, the
legal minimum age of marriage was set at 18 years for boys and 14 years for girls.
The history of child marriage in India dates back to pre-colonial times as it is considered that the
concept was present in early religious texts. The practice of child marriage was examined more
heavily when India was colonized.
Colonizers used to label the Indians as ‘Barbarians’, however they did not intervene or attempt to
end the practice out of fear of resistance from the Indians.

                                                        According to a research, Niger has the highest overall prevalence of child marriage in the world.
The data says 44% of girls in Niger are married before the girls attaining 18 years of age and
18% of girls are married before the age of 15 years.
According to UNICEF, Niger has the third highest absolute number of child marriage brides in
the world which is, 3,538,000 and it is at the 11th highest prevalence rate of child marriage
globally.
As per 2017 World Bank Study, it is estimated that child marriage costs Niger USD 7.6 billion in
lost earnings and productivity every year.
According to the 2017 UNICEF Report, State of The World's Children, the countries with the
highest rates of child marriage before age 18 years are as follows:

                                                        Initially, the Child Marriage Restraint Act ,1929 was brought into force as the social reforms group and individuals campaigned against the child marriage. But, this act however, failed due to
multiple reasons. The offence was also reported rarely since the act itself prohibited complaints
after 1 st year of marriage. Even in this act, women solemnizing marriage are not punishable but
the men are punishable, thereby contradicting the Article 14 which is the Right to Equality in the
Indian Constitution. The new act ‘Prohibition of Child Marriage Act’ was introduced in the year
2006. Many of these problems that were faced in the previous act, that is, Child Marriage
Restraint Act was legally addressed but the societal and cultural practice of child marriages still
continue to exist.
Child marriage affects not only the basic rights to freedom and life, but also has a negative
impact on the reproductive health of a girl child. Due to this, the rate of maternal and infant
mortality rate is high in case of child marriages.
Though the new act has come into force but, still there are loop holes like the act is inconsistent
with personal law. Since, few communities personal law still allows child marriage, and the
Prohibition of Child Marriage Act simultaneously tries to prevent them, the conflict leads to
signification legal complication. Also, registration of marriages has not been made compulsory
under this marriage which further leads to a lot of unreported child marriages.
