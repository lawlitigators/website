                                                    <p>
                                                        Rumours are a deadly weapon that affects the morale of the people. But tensions have always been a breeding ground of information operations. A few years ago, ‘fake news’ was a rarely used term but with the civilisation of social media it has put us into a grave position leading us to face fake news. 
                                                        Today, it has become one of the greatest threats to the civilians of our society where the society believes in every rumour on social media platform. These days the manipulation of the facts is just the propaganda of whistleblowers. Both, information and misinformation are at our fingertips. This only means that it is almost as easy to spread fake news as it is to verify it. At present internet is the only nexus between the audience where the world at large itself is an audience and recipients. Thus, social media is often accused of shaping public debate and unfairly engineering people's behaviour and undermining the democratic process instead of nurturing a healthy public sphere. 
                                                        Humans have an essential role in spreading the word. The effortless access to the internet world is both a boon and bane. Every coin has its two sides. The heart of this Article lies in the other side that is the bane of easily accessible social media networks. Rolling out fake news is no trifling act. People at large are overworked and become pretentious by the same cause. ‘Fake news’ has become a global concern since the rise of unpleasant incidents that have challenged the users’ trust in the news, especially through social media. There are no adequate preventive measures taken to curb the spreading of fake news and to hold people accountable for committing it.
                                                        <br>
                                                        Fake news not only turned out to be a curse for the common man, who find it difficult to distinguish from fiction but also for law enforcement agencies. Unlike other countries, the prime distributor of fake news in India is WhatsApp, but not other social networking sites like Facebook or Twitter. It has not only misinformed the users on social media but also triggered violence and barbaric killings around the country. In a country where innocents have been brutally killed by panicked mobs on the basis of rumours of child kidnappers spread on WhatsApp, this seems a justifiable fear. More so when there are a number of websites pretending to be news websites that peddle all sorts of hateful, communal propaganda with the tacit blessing of the ruling dispensation. According to a Microsoft report, Indian internet users are more likely to have been subjected to fake news than any others.

                                                    <p>
                                                        
                                                        • Citizenship amendment act (CAA)
                                                        One huge instance of outspreading of fake news before the COVID-19 cause came into the scene was the CAA (Citizenship Amendment Act)1 where the government was accused of establishing “Hindutva” over the nation. Uninformed and poorly literate population of the country demeaned the Act summoning it of being inaugurated against the Islamic Believers. The news channels also played a vital role in portrayal of communalism. The common unlearned man could not only grasp the language but also exhibited utter confusion led to spreading of fake news. Fake news doesn’t evolve intentionally always. Sometimes misconstruction of thoughts and ideas conveyed under common understanding configure fake news. Looking back at the time of debates involving CAA, a lot of communal riots arose over the nation. <br>
                                                        • COVID 19 (Corona)
                                                        Glancing at the current time, the common man already started declaring certain facts and the remedial actions speculated to be taken under the name of the government. All of this focuses on leading to rolling out of misinformation and immediately forming an opinion in the minds of civilians. For an instance, when LOCKDOWN: 1 ended, hundreds of labourers flocked to the stations hoping for the trains to commence the journeys taking them back to their hometown. 
                                                        While dealing with the set of circumstances, the Supreme Court of India held that the migration of large number of labourers working in the cities was triggered by panic created by fake news that the lock down would continue for more than three months2. Such panic caused migration and untold suffering to those who believed and acted on such fake news. In fact, some of the labourers have lost their lives while walking for hundreds of miles on foot. It is therefore not possible for us to overlook this menace of fake news either by electronic, print or social media. 
                                                        Amidst the pandemic of the corona virus, our nation is facing internal pandemic - fake news. The news channels actively blamed the Muslim community for the spread which later led to the repercussions on them apologizing for spreading hate against the community. The public health departments also face grave challenges in dealing with the spread of fake news. The public health department has spent sleepless night and struggling days to in order to curb this virus and their endeavour is all going in vain due to this comic spread of fake news; where the civilian has already proclaimed the antidotes of this virus and the preventive measures likely to be taken by the government. In all this chaos the people already have declared the various stages of the lockdown which should rather be announced by government in the first place. The sources of such fact just do one job that is to misguide the people of our nation. The customary man in general should be accused. <br>
                                                        • Election: 2019
                                                        In India's backdrop, fake news is difficult to constraint. With millions of inhabitants with the access to internet, fake news can emerge out of nowhere. In the context of 2019 elections, 'fake news' is a synonym of 'paid news'. The Election Commissioner has been entitled with the right of debarring the candidate who uses sources as paid and fake news for the propaganda of winning the context. However it's a task for the Commissioner to have an eye for detail and to take action against the unlawful speech- hate speech, bribery for votes, communalism, and cases alike. 
                                                        Rather than focusing on the content element of fake news the EC would be better off in trying to unearth who is spending and whether candidates have made adequate declarations. While curbs are placed on candidates’ spending, no such limitations are placed on the spending of political parties. Even if candidate spending were to be tracked, it would still be an uphill task to prove that there was unreported spending on fake news.

                                                        In India, the spread of fake messages on social media has created an unprecedented crisis. Lynch mobs, often prejudice against certain minority communities and incensed by fake news, are taking the lives of innocent while the law and order system grapples with rising violence. In 2018 the spread of false rumours of child abduction and cow slaughter resulted in widespread mob violence and lynching where the accused were beaten or killed. As many as 24 people were killed in mob attacks only in 2018.
                                                        
                                                        Maharashtra, Jharkhand, Assam, Tamil Nadu, Telangana and Karnataka states have witnessed the worst of mob lynching cases owing to fake news. The situation has become so dangerous that the Supreme court of India has stated that our country has become a “mobocracy” where quick vigilante justice has become the new norm.3

                                                        Constitutional provisions:
                                                        <br>
                                                        1. The Constitution of India, under Article 19 (1) (a)4 grants each citizen of India, the freedom of speech and expression5. However, the said Fundamental Right is not absolute and can have reasonable restrictions; like in this routine of pandemic and fake news, it can be restricted in interest of the sovereignty and integrity of India, the security of the State, friendly relations with foreign States, public order, decency or morality, or about contempt of court, defamation or incitement to an offense. Hence, any attempt to suppress the voice of people in a public sphere behind the garb of an Anti-Fake News Bill will lead to a situation of a constitutional violation. Many could claim that it’s conflicting to restrict the right inherent to the citizen. However, as a preventive measure, various State Governments have come up with internet shutdowns. 
                                                        
                                                        2. Section 505(1) of Indian Penal Code, 1860: whoever by making, publishing or circulating any statement, rumour or report which may cause fear or alarm to the public or to any section of the public shall be punished with imprisonment which may extend to three years, or with fine, or with both.6
                                                        3. Section 66D of Information Technology Act: whoever, by means for any communication device or computer resource cheats by personating shall be punish with the imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three years and shall also be liable to fine which may extend to one lakh rupees.7
                                                        4. Section 54 of the Disaster Management Act, 2005: Whoever makes or circulates a false alarm or warning as to disaster or its severity or magnitude, leading to panic shall be punish with the Imprisonment which may extend to one year or with fine.8
                                                        Also, Some people are panicking, and looking to magical cures, and other’s with vested interest are spreading conspiracies against the governments, communities and trying to create racial, communal or religious unrest, the acts which can be prosecuted under section 153/153A of Indian Penal code. Recently, an idea such as linking Aadhaar to social media accounts has been suggested to the Supreme Court of India by the Attorney General.9

                                                        Since 2018, until now the government exercise in total 252 internet shutdowns in all. The longest shutdown in the history of India commenced on 4th August 2019 when the article 370 of the Indian constitution was abrogated by the parliament of India. This internet shutdown existed for 213 days and ceased on 4th March 2020. This happened to prevent the spreading of fake news, communalism and misinformation10.

                                                    <p>
                                                        In my suggestion, the source of the predominant facts and news should be limited to one only. This reminds me of the childhood group game of “Chinese Whisper" where the information at the initial stage is accurate and has an existential crisis while reaching the end. It is correctly said that too many cooks spoil the broth. Involvement of too many people in the release of major facts hampers both, the process and the news. 
                                                        Based on the analysis and summaries above, I find out that fake news has a deep relationship with social media and politics. A combination of media affordances and systemic trends: the design of social media platforms and search engines, and the intense competitive pressure on professional journalism caused by the digitalization of news and the acceleration of news cycles.
                                                        User’s network on social media is segregated. Users add people as friends on social media mainly because they share similar backgrounds or same interests. So what appear on their news feed could be the contents they would love to read and believe. 
                                                        Therefore, we can conclude that fake news is one form of dysfunctional hybridity in the hybrid media system. Also the PIL is pending before the Supreme Court which was filed on 24th Apr., 2020 for assistance from the Centre to curb the spread of fake news.11 Through social media, fake news could have extensive influence not only 2019 election, mob lynching, CAA or COVID -19 Pandemic, but also other fields related to our daily life. </p>

                                                    <p>
                                                        The basic efforts are assured to protect the essential human rights of all Indian people and are put to bear by the Judiciary, due to a few restrictions. Ability to Uniformity is one such critical privilege. As the essay speaks for itself that when it comes to justice all is handled the same. The statute calls for property to be represented regardless of all factors.
                                                        For a rule-based country like India, or any modern society regulation for that matter, plays a very critical role. For India, moving in with various values, this article takes us under the massive umbrella of equity and interest. Subsequently, Article 14 should be regarded as the foundation of our structure; showing that no stone should be swept up unturned; that no person with profit should be able to stand on the property of someone with fewer benefits. Policy is one and the same for everyone.
                                                        
                                                    </p>
                                                    <h5 class="text-uppercase">MEANING AND ORIGIN</h5>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Article 14 is a directive to the state that it shall not deny Equal protection of law and Equality before the law to whosoever within the geographical boundaries of India. Article 14 combines two very important aspects. First one is ‘Rule of Law’, a British Doctrine which was set forth by Prof. Dicey and ‘Equal Protection of the Laws’, which comes from Clause 14th from the US Constitution putting intensity and strength in the article which is there to ensure equality in a country of millions. But the Supreme Court had to at times lessen this vigor of article 14 so as to ensure that the welfare programs can operate without hurdles.1

                                                    <h5 class="text-uppercase">LATEST ASPECTS OF ARTICLE 14</h5>
                                                    
                                                    <p>  
                                                        With time, Article 14 evolved and a new dimension was added in it in the very famous E.P Royappa vs. State of Tamil Nadu and Anr., in which it was held that Article 14 is a notion that is actively changing. At the same time, it is no way possible that it can be damaged, and can be kept inside limited boundaries of any practice or concepts. Irrationality and impartiality are poles apart as former emphasizes on a system deprived of freedom; and the latter emphasizes on liberty and fairness. Any legislation that does not follow the concept of reasonableness can be called bureaucratically and constitutionally against the Article of Equality.

                                                        Uncertainty followed it from managing the British exhibition of justice. This means that no man is above the law and is subject to the authority of standard courts by each person, everything is his rank or condones. "With us" Dicey wrote “every official from the prime minister down to constable or a collector of taxes is under the same responsibility for every act done without legal justification as any other citizen". Prof. Dicey gave 3 meanings of the rule of law-
                                                        1. Absence of arbitrary power or supremacy of the law.
                                                        2. Equality before the law
                                                        3. The constitution is the result of the ordinary law of the land. 
                                                        • The third aspect doesn't apply to the Indian constitution

                                                    <h5 class="text-uppercase">EQUALITY BEFORE LAW AND ABSOLUTE EQUALITY</h5>
                                                    <p>
                                                        The principle of uniformity does not establish cruel supreme equilibrium for human beings which is biologically unimaginable. Dr Jennings explains it this way: 
                                                        “Equality before the law means that among equals the law should be equal and should be equally administered, that like should be treated alike. The freedom to sue and be charged, punished and prosecuted over the same form of crime would be the same for all people of complete age and awareness without distinctions of ethnicity, faith, education, socioeconomic class or political sophistication”.</p>

                                                        <p>
                                                            Rule of law embodied in Article 14 is the ‘Basic Feature’ of the Indian constitution and hence, it cannot be destroyed by any amendment under Article 368 of the Indian Constitution.
                                                            The words ‘Any Person' in Article 14 of the Indian Constitution denotes that the guarantee of the equal protection of laws is available to any person which includes any company or association or body of individuals. The protection of Article 14 extends to both citizens and non-citizens and to natural persons as well as legal persons.

Article 359 which suspends the enforcement of fundamental rights as the time of emergency also suspends Article 14. Article 361 provides that the President of India and the Governors of the States cannot face any legal order at the time when they are performing some official work under their power. They are immune from court cases except in some situations. As per Article 105 and Article 194, the MLAs and MPs charged with the case of defamation when they are inside the parliament retains actions inside the Legislative Assembly and Parliament. The officers arriving from different counties to India cannot be prosecuted.

In any case, the classification must not be "arbitrary, false or deceptive," but must be based on a few real and relevant specifics with a reasonable and responsive relation to the grievance that the law aims to achieve.
                                                            Class legislation is that which allows an unacceptable division by offering clear advantages to a class of people, self-assuredly selected from a wide number of citizens, all of whom are in the same relation to the advantage and that no sensible criterion or difference can be made between them and the citizens not so favored, legitimizing the integration of one and the other.

The Intelligible Differentia Theory will be promoted. The introduction and extension of Article 14 has widened the breadth step by stage, the nexus check and the principle of non-arbitrariness are the simplest illustration of that. Article 14 is a huge principle that needs to be held current with the increasing conditions of civilization and the appropriate justice procedure. Rick Riordan 's quotation correctly suits in here, "Fairness doesn't mean everybody is having the same. Fairness ensures everybody get what they need”.</p>

                                                    <p>
                                                        When independent India was making the constitution, they already had a lot of nations as example which adopted the concept of Democracy and Humanitarian. So, the founding fathers of the constitution endeavored to formulate something which reflects multiple things like Rights of Minority, Principles of UDHR etc. and after the discussion of many days, the very idea of fundamental rights was borrowed from America’s Bill of Rights.
                                                        Fundamental Rights are those rights which are essential for every human being to live a life in dignified manner and it also helps in overall development of an individual. These rights are enshrined in Part III (Article 12-Article 35) of Indian Constitution.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <h6 class="text-uppercase">Article 12 and Article 13 of Indian constitution</h6>
                                                    <p>
                                                        As per Article 12 of the constitution, State includes the Government and Parliament of India and the Government and the Legislature of each of the States and all local or other authorities within the territory of India or under the control of the Government of India. This definition of the state is only applicable to Part III and Part IV of the Constitution and does not extend to the other provisions of the constitution. In the case of Electricity Board, Rajasthan v. Mohan Lal it was held that the expression ‘other authorities’ includes all authorities created by the Constitution or statute to whom the powers are conferred by the law. It was also seen that it was not necessary that the statutory authority should be engaged in performing governmental or sovereign function.
                                                        Article 13 of the Constitution deals with ‘Laws’ that are inconsistent with Fundamental Rights guaranteed to the Citizens. This is one of the most important articles and crux of why Fundamental Rights are an integral part of our Constitution. This is that Article that makes Fundamental Rights justiciable and hence, enforceable in courts of law.
                                                        
                                                    </p>
                                                    <h5 class="text-uppercase">ARTICLE 13-LAWS IN DEROGATION WITH FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS WILL BE VOID</h5>
                                                    <p>  
                                                        Article 13(1) deals with pre constitution laws, which means the laws which existed before the Constitution of India came into existence, and, if such laws are against fundamental rights they shall become invalid now the extent to which they shall remain invalid shall be determined by the application of two doctrines viz. Doctrine of Severability / Separability and Doctrine of Eclipse.
                                                        <br>
                                                        Doctrine of Severability/Separability, is a guardian of our fundamental rights. Suppose, if any of the provisions in an act/statue is contrary to our fundamental rights then that provision only would consider being void and it is not the whole act that becomes void. The same can be explained by a very important case related to this doctrine A.K. Gopalan v. State of Madras (AIR 1950 SC 27). In this case, the Section 14 of Prevention Detention Act was challenged. According to Section 14, if any person is detained under this respective act, he cannot disclose grounds of detention in the court. So, Section 14 was against the fundamental rights, if you apply doctrine of severability here and filter out this act, only Section 14 of the Act was not respecting fundamental rights. So, according to doctrine, if we filter our Prevention Detention Act only the Section 14 is inconsistent with fundamental right. So, we will minus only this provision (Section 14) from the act, and remaining act shall be valid.
                                                        <br>
                                                        The Doctrine of Eclipse (means to hide) was lightened up by Supreme Court in the case of Bhikhaji v. State of Madhya Pradesh (AIR 1955 SC 781). The Supreme Court in this case held that any law which is inconsistent with fundamental rights is not invalid or dead totally but it becomes inoperative and it is over shadowed by fundamental rights (i.e. fundamental rights should prevail over such law which is inconsistent) and when the inconsistency is removed by constitutional amendment from the relevant fundamental rights, then the eclipse vanishes and the entire law becomes valid.
                                                        <br>
                                                        Further, Article 13(2) talks about post constitutional laws, meaning the laws that came into existence after Indian Constitution, where the state is prohibited to make any such laws which abridges the rights of citizens. Therefore, if there is any such law which violates Fundamental Rights then it becomes void ab initio. Moreover, any law made in the contravention of this clause shall, to the extent of the contravention be void.
                                                        <br>
                                                        Article 13(3) of the Constitution gives the overview of the term 'LAW'. Every law which affects the legal rights of the citizens will be consider as law under article 13(3) for example Bye-laws, regulations, customs, etc. but does not include personal laws. 
                                                        Now the question aroused that can Parliament make amendments under an act which are against the Fundamental Rights?
                                                        In Shankari Prasad v. Union Of India (AIR 1951 SC458) it was held that ‘Law’ in Article 13 is ordinary law made under the legislative powers and therefore Parliament, under Article 368, has the power to amend any part of the constitution including fundamental rights. The Court gave the same ruling in Sajjan Singh v. State of Rajasthan.
                                                        But in the case of Golaknath v. State of Punjab (AIR 1967 SC 1643), the Supreme Court overruled its earlier decision and, it was held that Parliament has no power to amend Part III of the constitution. After this case Parliament made the 24th Constitutional Amendment Act, 1971 in which Article 13(4) was included which meant that any amendment made under Article 368 cannot be challenged under Article 13.
                                                        Further, in the case of Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerela (AIR 1973 SC 146), the Supreme Court reviewed its Golaknath Case decision and was held that Parliament could amend any part of the Constitution so long as it did not alter or amend ‘the basic structure or essential features of the Constitution.’

                                                        Uncertainty followed it from managing the British exhibition of justice. This means that no man is above the law and is subject to the authority of standard courts by each person, everything is his rank or condones. "With us" Dicey wrote “every official from the prime minister down to constable or a collector of taxes is under the same responsibility for every act done without legal justification as any other citizen". Prof. Dicey gave 3 meanings of the rule of law-
                                                        1. Absence of arbitrary power or supremacy of the law.
                                                        2. Equality before the law
                                                        3. The constitution is the result of the ordinary law of the land. 
                                                        • The third aspect doesn't apply to the Indian constitution
                                                    </p>
                                                    <h5 class="text-uppercase">CONCLUSION</h5>
                                                    <p>Article 13 is the most debatable issue of our constitutional history. Basically, the need for this article in our constitution was for the citizens so that they can protect their fundamental rights (Guaranteed under Part III of Constitution) against the state. The constitution makers were aware that the government often finds them inconvenient in their functioning. Therefore, to stop the government from manipulating these Fundamental rights, this Article was inserted.</p>

                                                    <p> By the word ‘Preamble’ itself, one can understand that it is the introductory part of any statue or deed which states the purpose, aims and justification. It sets the tone of the constitution.  It can also be known as the Blueprint of any act.  Basically, the Preamble of India, interprets, guides and provide sources of the constitution, its nature and the objectives. It shortly covers all the elements of the constitution. If one needs to know the constitution of the country, they can simply reach out to the preamble of it. The ideals of the preamble were laid down by Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, which was later adopted by the constitution. By the word, ‘By The People, For The People & Of The People’ it clearly means that, it is the people who choose the government and it is made up of people who emerge and rise to the position from the common people. Basically it says that the government comprises of common people who were chosen and equally elected by the common people. Preamble is an essential component of a constitution. It comprises of a summary or essence of the constitution. The basic idea behind framing the preamble was that it conforms to norms and ideals of the constitution and express the philosophy and guidance of the maker in few words.</p>

                                                    <p>
                                                        Initially, the preamble was drafted by SH.B.N. Rau in his memorandum of May 30, 1947, & was later reproduced in the draft on October 7, 1947. The Preamble of India is based upon the ‘Objective Resolution’ which was introduced by Jawaharlal Nehru in the Constituent Assembly on December 13, 1946 and later was enacted and forced as a resolution on January 22, 1947.  The Original Preamble of India constituted and declared the country into ‘Sovereign, Democratic and Republic’.  During the time of the National Emergency our constitution was modified and later amended, with the 42nd Constitutional Amendment, 1976, which is also popularly known as ‘MINI CONSTITUTION’. Along with the amendment two new concepts ‘Socialist and Secular’ were added making it into “Sovereign Socialist Secular Democratic & Republic”. 
                                                        Its ideology and objective includes SOVEREIGN SOCIALIST SECULAR DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC and to secure all its citizens. 
                                                        JUSTICE, social, economic and political;
                                                        LIBERTY of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship;
                                                        EQUALITY of status and of opportunity; and to promote among them all;
                                                        FRATERNITY assuring the dignity of the individual and the unity and integrity of the Nation.

                                                    <p>
                                                        As per Article 12 of the constitution, State includes the Government and Parliament of India and the Government and the Legislature of each of the States and all local or other authorities within the territory of India or under the control of the Government of India. This definition of the state is only applicable to Part III and Part IV of the Constitution and does not extend to the other provisions of the constitution. In the case of Electricity Board, Rajasthan v. Mohan Lal it was held that the expression ‘other authorities’ includes all authorities created by the Constitution or statute to whom the powers are conferred by the law. It was also seen that it was not necessary that the statutory authority should be engaged in performing governmental or sovereign function.
                                                        Article 13 of the Constitution deals with ‘Laws’ that are inconsistent with Fundamental Rights guaranteed to the Citizens. This is one of the most important articles and crux of why Fundamental Rights are an integral part of our Constitution. This is that Article that makes Fundamental Rights justiciable and hence, enforceable in courts of law.
                                                        
                                                    </p>
                                                    <h5 class="text-uppercase">Meaning of the features: </h5>
                                                    <p>
                                                        The term SOVEREIGN means, India is a democratic country and all the decisions and affairs are maintained by the government of the country itself. Sovereignty denotes the ultimate & supreme power. It may be real or normal, legal or political, individual or pluralistic. Under sovereign government, the power is vested into the hands of the elected representatives where no external power can domain or interfere into the matters of the country. The country is ruled by its own representative’s head. The legislature only, has an absolute power to make the rules which is binding upon the citizens of the country.
                                                        <br>
                                                        SOCIALIST, was added through the 42th Amendment Act, 1976.  Socialist certainly refers to the society, by which the government must achieve the socialist goals through non-violent means. Under socialist government, the wealth is generated socially and equally among the citizens of the country without basis of any discrimination through distributive justice. The wealth and economy shall not just be concentrated in the hands of a few. The distribution and production of goods and services falls under the authority of the state.  There must not be any differentiation among the people in the eye of the justice. Every individual must be paid equally for their hard work. The main aim to insert socialism was to eliminate inequality in income and standard of life of the working people.  
                                                        <br>

Every individual has the power to vote once he/she reaches the age of majority as prescribed by the law.

That is, law is equal for every person thereby creating an egalitarian society. Rights are vague if they are not enjoyed equally.

                                                    <p>
                                                        
                                                        We all are aware that India and United States are the two largest democracies in the world. These two nations are also constitutional republics, which are bound by a written constitution. The Preamble of the Constitution of United States and the Constitution India also starts with “We the people” which moves in the Preamble of Constitution. However, the attitude of the general public and the political establishment towards the constitution are different in the US and India. The American constitution is just 4,543 words long, whereas the Indian constitution has 1, 45,000 words. The US preamble serves as an introduction and it does not assign the powers to the federal government, nor does it provide specific limitation on government actions. Whereas the Indian preamble is considered as the significant part of the Indian constitution which mainly focusing on the objectives of the Indian constitution. The Fundamental Rights in India are vast than in the United States. The Indian Constitution has eleven articles which discuss about the languages. In contrast, the American constitution does not talk about languages at all. The US has no ‘Official’ or ‘National’ language. American federation is based on agreement between the States whereas Indian Federation is not based on agreement which is between the States. India has Single Citizenship for both the States and Union. Whereas in the US there is a dual citizenship, that is the Federal and State Citizenship.

                                                    <p>The preamble is an introductory part of the constitution. Preamble highlights the main objectives and its adoption and nature. Constitution is the Supreme law of India. The document lays down the political, procedure, powers and duties of the Government and sets out Fundamental Rights, Directive Principles of State Policies and Duties of all the citizens. In the Constitution, it states how the government shall run, distribution of powers among the Legislative, Executive and Judiciary. Preamble highlights the ideals of the constitution which aims at achieving social, economic, and political justice. It states the importance of liberty of thought and maintains the dignity of an individual and the nation. We can change the preamble by amendment procedure given in constitution, but we cannot change the basic structure of the constitution. </p>

                                                    <p>
                                                        The utmost important question arises is whether preamble is a part of constitution or not? There were several arguments arrived upon it. The most two prominent cases which discuss this question are: <br>
                                                        1. Beruberi Case, 1960: Under this case, the Supreme Court has declared that preamble cannot be a part of Constitution. And also it is not enforceable in a Court of Law. It does not able to prohibit the explicit powers which are illustrated in constitution.
                                                        <br>
                                                        2. Kesavananda Bharti Case, 1973: It was the most landmark case which held with a bench of 13 judges of the Supreme Court hearing the writ petition. It changed the previous decision of the Court. Under this, the Supreme Court has announced that preamble is a very pat of the Constitution. And it can be subjected to amend under the Article 368 of the Constitution of India. Parliament has certain power only to amend the Constitution but the basic structure of the Constitution cannot be amended.  Under Article 368 of Constitution, gives power to form formal amendments and empowers parliament to form amends by the mean of addition, variation or modification consistent with the procedure established by Law. 
                                                    </p>
                                                    <h5 class="text-uppercase">CONCLUSION:</h5>
                                                    <p>By far we can say, Preamble is an ultimate source of Constitution. And without Preamble it would be very difficult to understand the whole Constitution by large. Preamble highlights the very basic structure and nature of Constitution, briefly. It focuses mainly on basic fundamental values and ideologies which were encrypted and drafted by the Founding Fathers. It serves as a manual to the Constitution. Hence, it is a basic and necessary part of Constitution. Several phenomena of the Constitution have been adopted from various countries. The preamble focuses that the people of India have adopted, enacted and gave to themselves the Constitution on the 26th day of November, 1949 but the date of commencement was fixed to the 26th day of January, 1950. Preamble has a pivotal role in stating the Constitution and reflecting the spirit of Constitution to form and nourish the country into Sovereign, Socialist, Secular, Democratic, Republic, Justice, Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity among its members.</p>

                                                        Our Constitution says that, Equality Before Law, that is, the State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the law within the territory of India. If, the functionaries of the law become law-breakers, it is bound to breed contempt for the law and encourage lawlessness. 
Police, the most important organisation of the society, are considered as a representative of the government. Police brutality is legally defined as an offence which is violation of civil rights of an individual. Police brutality means use of excessive and unnecessary force by police officers against public.

<br>
    • False arrest and wrong imprisonment <br>

                                                    <p>
                                                        Police brutality is not new in this modern world. It is a societal issue that was noted since industrial revolution in the year 1870's when law enforcement would physically harm the workers. The term ‘Police Brutality’ was used for the first time in the year 1872 in the American press, when the tribunal of Chicago reported the beating of a civilian under arrest at the Harrison street police station. Records suggest that Labour strikes were the first large-scale incidents of police brutality in the United States, including events like the Great Railroad Strike of the year 1877, the Pullman Strike of the year 1894, the Lawrence textile strike of the year 1912, the Ludlow massacre of the year 1914, the Great Steel Strike of the year 1919. In India, the Jallianwala Bagh Massacre incident took place on 13th of July, 1919, where police killed atleast 400 people and injured over 1500 people. It was the case of Police Brutality. In the movement of 1960's the police used high power water guns on the civilians and sometimes, attack was made on the public with the help of Police dogs.

                                                    <p>
                                                        There are still many cases of Police brutality in different countries like America, India, etc. In spite of so many protests, the cases are still increasing. There are many cases of Police brutality in India. Following are the few cases of Police brutality held in India: <br> 
1. The Thoothukudi violence incident, which was held in Thoothukudi, Tamil Nadu in the year 2018, where thirteen unarmed protestors were killed and more than 100 were injured by the police officer of Tamil Nadu. <br>
2. The Andhra shootout incident which was held in Seshachalan forest in Chittoor district, Andhra Pradesh in the year 2015, where 20 suspected woodcutters were killed.  <br>
3.  Mohamed Huzaifa Javed Ahmed vs The State of Maharashtra <br>
In this case, the police have brutally beaten a child with an excess amount of force which resulted to his death. The police officer was removed from his position and entitled to imprisonment.
The very recent one being the Tamil Nadu case, which was held in 2020, June, where the father P Jeyaraj & son Bennix was the victim of Police brutality. Here, they were arrested because they kept their shop open during the lockdown period. They were taken to the Police station and 3rd degree torture method was used on them. Police officers involved in this incident was suspended. 
Not only in India, but also in US, there is a recent case of Police brutality. In this case, George Floyd died after being arrested by police outside a shop in Minneapolis, Minnesota. This incident took place on the 25th of May, 2020, where, the Police Officer Derek Chauvin, pressed his knees into the neck of George, for 8 minutes and 46 seconds. Gorge Floyd died in this incident. However, the Police Officer, Derek was charged with murder.

                                                    <p>
                                                        According to the comparative study of police brutality in India and America, police brutality rate of America in 2019:
1,004 people were shot and killed by police whereas the mapping police violence project counted 1,098 killed. Since the 20th century, there have been many public, private and community efforts to combat police corruption and brutality. Like America, India too has a problem of excessive police brutality. According to the status of policing in India report, 2019, 70 police stations across 20 states didn't have wireless communication, 214 had no access to telephone, 240 were without vehicles. However, quiet similar to the racial bias of US police, Indian police often place a partisan role during communal riots, which is one reason such riots continue to take place. As per the data from the National Crime Records Bureau, 1,727 people died in police custody during the time period between 2001 and 2018. However, just 26 policemen were convicted of custodial violence during the same period.

                                                    <h5 class="text-uppercase">CONCLUSION:</h5>
                                                    <p> Police officers are given freedom of action, thoughts, etc. in performing their duties.  They are given a great deal of as they are expected to protect the public and confront violent individuals, they can legally use physical, and even deadly force under certain circumstances. Police officers are one who should reform the law and not break it. Legal systems exists for a reason.  If the saviour of the law itself, are the destructor of the rule, there will definitely be contempt, rage, disappointment, misery among the citizens towards the police. Police brutality comes under Police corruption, which is consider to be a misconduct. Though police brutality is considered as a severe offence but still, there are many cases where the complaint of an individual does not even reach to the investigation stage. A police officers must protect their citizens and should not brutality beat them.</p>

                                                        In the 21st century lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender are openly coming up in society and demanding their rights. In India, LGBT community have limited rights and also they face social problems from non-LGBT persons. Article 15 of the Indian Constitution states, Prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth.
                                                        <br>
                                                        (1) The State shall not discriminate against any citizen on grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex, place of birth or any of them.

                                                    Transgender people are allowed to change their legal gender as per post-sex reassignment surgery under legislation passed in 2019. Transgender people got their rights after the Supreme Court of India gave judgment on Section 377 where, the Supreme Court stated that Section 377 is unconstitutional as it violates the Fundamental Rights as per Article 14 of the Indian Constitution which states Equality Before Law. It is a landmark decision for LGBT community and their rights since the Country’s independence.

                                                        India has considered third gender population as neither male or female. They are called as Hijras in Indian Society. Hijras were legally granted voting rights in 1994. On the 15th of April, 2014, the Supreme Court of India considered transgender community as socially and economically backward class. <br>
In 2013, transgender activist S. Swapna and Gopi Shankar Madurai started protest and demanded reservation for LGBTQ community to permit alternate genders to appear for examination such as UPSC, SSC, and Bank exams, Also Swapna is the first transgender person who cleared TNPSC Group IV exams. <br>
In the case of Navtej Singh Johar vs. Union of India, the Supreme Court asserted that the Indian Constitution bans discrimination based on sexual category. <br>
Before 2018, LGBTQ community were banned in armed forces but Jagdambika Pal introduced the bill in parliament to amend the Army Qct 1950, Navy act 1957, Air Force Act 1950  that would allow LGBT community to serve Nation through Army.

                                                    <p>
                                                        The first national gay rights organization the Mattachine society was formed in 1951 was created by Harry Hay. The first lesbian rights organization in the US was founded in 1955.The daughters of Bilitis was founded in San Francisco California by activist couple Del Martin and Philips Lyon. From about 1988, activists began to use the initialism LGBTQ in United States. Not until the 1990s within the movement did gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people gain equal respect. This spurred some organizations to adopt new names as the GLBT Historical society did in 1999. The best known case of homosexuality in Ancient Egypt is that of the two high officials Nyankh – khnum and Khnum – hotep. Both men lived and served under Pharaoh Niuserre during the 5th dynasty.
The gay rights movement saw some early progress in the 1960s. In 1961 Illinois became the first state to do away with its anti-sodomy laws, effectively decriminalizing homosexuality and a local TV station in California aired the first documentary about homosexuality call the rejected. The month of June was chosen for LGBTQ Pride month to commemorate the Stonewall riots which occurred at the end of the June 1969. As a result, many pride events are held during this month to recognize the impact of LGBTQ people have had in the world. LGBTQ OR GLBT is an intialism that stands for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender. In use since the 1990s the term is an adaption of the Intialism LGBTQ which was used to replace the term gay in reference to the LGBT community beginning in the mid – to – late 1980s.As in 2020, LGBTQ History Month is a month-long celebration that is specific to Hungary, the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Brazil, Greenland, and the city of Berlin. In the United States, Canada, and Australia, it is celebrated in October to coincide with National Coming Out Day on 11 October.

                                                    <p>
                                                        LGBTQ history dates back to the first recorded instances of same sex love and sexuality of ancient civilizations involving the history of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender(LGBTQ) people and cultures around the world. What survives after many centuries of persecution – resulting in shame, suppression, and secrecy has only in more recent decades been pursued and interwoven into more mainstream historical narratives. Rights affecting lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender LGBTQ people vary greatly by country or jurisdiction compassing everything from the legal recognition of same sex marriage to the death penalty for homosexuality. Notably as of 2020, 29 countries recognize same-sex marriage they are Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, brazil, Canada, costa Rica, Denmark, Ecuador, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Malta, Mexico, the United states, and Uruguay. By contrast, not counting non-state actors and extrajudicial killings, only one country is believed to impose the death penalty on consensual same-sex sexual acts: Iran. The death penalty is on the books but, as far as is known, not enforced in Afghanistan, Brunei, Mauritania, Nigeria (in the northern third of the country), Saudi Arabia and Somalia (in the autonomous Jubaland region). Sudan rescinded its unenforced death penalty for anal sex (hetero- or homosexual) in 2020. 15 countries have stoning on the books as a penalty for adultery, which would include gay sex, but this is only enforced by the legal authorities in Iran. In 2011 the United nations Human Rights Council passed its first resolution recognizing LGBT Rights following which the office of the united nations High Commissioner for Human Rights issued a report documenting violations of the LGBTQ People including hate crimes, criminalization of homosexual activity, and discrimination. Following the issuance of the report, the United Nations urged all countries which had not yet done so to enact laws protecting basic LGBTQ rights.

In addition to shortening the deferral period from a life ban to 12 months, the new revision includes the statement that for the purposes of questioning, gender should be considered on a “self-identified and self-reported” basis. <br>
2016 - President Obama dedicated the new Stonewall National Monument in Greenwich Village, Lower Manhattan, as the first US National Monument to honor the LGBTQ rights movement.

Also, Sexual Orientation is an essential attribute of privacy. The Right to Privacy and the security of sexual orientation lies at the core Fundamental Rights guaranteed by Article 14, 15 and 21 of the Indian Constitution.</p>

                                                    <p> 
                                                        Juvenile law is a system of law that is intended to protect and promote the human rights of all
young people. It is a branch of law that deals with minor or underaged persons who have been
accused of offenses or who are neglected or abandoned by their parents or guardians. The fact is,
it is more concerned with the rehabilitation of charges then adult criminal justice in the context
of a juvenile who is accused of offenses which are termed in law as ‘Juvenile’ conflicts with the
law. There are international standards that exist and these standards emphasize the importance of
both prevention as well as rehabilitation. International standards recognize that &quot;the right of
every child alleged as, accused of, or recognized as having infringed the penal law to be treated
in a manner consistent with the promotion of the child&#39;s sense of dignity and worth.&quot;
                                                    </p>
                                                    <h5 class="text-uppercase">who is a juvenile</h5>
                                                    <p>
                                                        A child who has not attained a certain age, at which, like an adult, under the law of the land, can be held liable for his criminal acts.
                                                        The term juvenile justice emerged from the Latin words &#39;Juvenis&#39;, which means &#39;young&#39;. Hence, a juvenile justice system is one that is specially established for the young.
                                                        As per the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act 2015, the term &#39;Juvenile&#39; refers to a child below the age of 18 years. <br>
                                                    <h5 class="text-uppercase">Need for Separate Criminal Justice for Juveniles</h5>
                                                    <p>
                                                        It is a fundamental principle in law that if unequals are brought on one platform and treated in
the same manner, that would result in inequality, not equality. Thus, children are differently
situated from adults. They are one of the most vulnerable section of the society and are victims
of exploitation and abuse by parents, guardians, and the society at large.
Hence, they require a humane approach, instead of a law and order approach or a retributive
approach to justice.                  
                                                    </p>
                                                    <h5 class="text-uppercase">Juvenile Delinquency</h5>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Juvenile delinquents are those who have not attained the age of adulthood as per the law of the
land, and have yet, acted in a manner that is prohibited by law. Such prohibited behaviour largely
consists of acts that would be termed as offenses under criminal law when committed by adults.
Since a child is a part of society, social context around him/her is bound to have an effect on
child behaviour and attitude, poverty, unemployment, exposer to and experience violence abuse
inequalities, and changing values are bound to impact children and their behaviour.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <h5 class="text-uppercase">Juvenile justice policy in India is largely governed by the constitutional
                                                        mandate given under Article 15:</h5>
                                                    <p>
                                                        The policy is also founded on constitutional guarantees such as the Right to Equality, Protection
of Life and Personal Liberty and the Right against Exploitation (enshrined in Articles 14, 15, 16,
21, 23 and 24.
The Indian constitution emphasizes the duty of the state to prevent exploitation of children and to
promote children welfare.
                                                    </p>
                    
                                                    <h5 class="text-uppercase">Evolution of the Act</h5>
                                                    <p> So, the juvenile justice policy in India is not only based on the Constitution of India but also,
                                                        influenced by international standards and jurisprudence. The first act or the legislation on
                                                        juvenile justice in India came in 1850 known as the Apprentice Act, 1850 which said that
                                                        children between the ages of 10-18 years convicted in courts were to be provided training as a
                                                        part of their rehabilitation process. This act was substituted by the Reformatory Schools Act,
                                                        1897 which, subsequently provided that children up to the age of 15 years may be sent to the
                                                        Reformatory Cell, and later the Juvenile Justice Act, 1986 provided a uniform mechanism of
                                                        Juvenile Justice. This act was replaced by the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection) Act, 2000.
                                                        In the case of Nirbhaya also known as the Delhi Gang Rape case which happened on the 16 th of
                                                        December 2012 where, a juvenile was also accused of gang rape but was treated under the
                                                        provisions of the juvenile justice act as juvenile even though the crime was heinous. This, was
                                                        the major drawback that even the crime was heinous the juvenile was treated under that act and
                                                        therefore, after the protest the bill was passed by the Rajya Sabha known as Juvenile Justice Bill
                                                        2014 and the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2000 was replaced in 2015
                                                        by a new law – Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015.</p>

                                                                Juveniles, nowadays are actively committing crimes which are heinous like murder, rape, etc.
                                                                and the law is insufficient for giving punishment to the juveniles according to the crime
                                                                committed by them. Age must not only be the criteria to punish the offenders. It should be on the

                                                        Childhood is all about having fun with friends and family. Childhood is meant to be enjoyed and
                                                        study and plan about future career. Everyone wishes that their childhood should be a memorable one with lots of good memories. But, it is sad to know that many children are not able to live their childhood phase. Many of them are forced by their family or guardian for child marriage.
                                                    </p>
                                                </p>Child marriage, means a marriage whether be a formal or an informal marriage of child below
                                                the age of 18 years. Mostly, the child marriage occurs of a young girl, that is, of a girl under age
                                                of 18 years to an older man or say a boy. Child marriage is still practiced in many parts of the
                                                world, and affects girls and women from different communities.</p>
                                                <p>As compared to the world, about more than 40% of    child marriage takes place in India, even
                                                    though 18 years is the legal age of marriage. About 27% of girls in India are married before 18
                                                    years of age and 7% are married before 15 years of age. According to UNICEF, India has the
                                                    highest number of child brides in the world, that is, 15,509,000. Child marriage is banned in
                                                    India and the laws are made very stringent against child marriage, but still such customs continue

                                                    An act to restrain the solemnization of child marriage was enacted. The act came into force on
                                                    the 1 st day of April, 1930 and is named as Child Marriage Restraint Act, 1929.</p>

                                                    <p>
                                                        The reason behind child marriages is, often gender inequality and the belief that girls and women overall are an inferior and dependent section of the society. But, in India, child marriage is also driven by many other reasons.</p>
                                                        Some of them are as follows: 
                                                        <p>1. POVERTY- Marrying their daughters to reduce their perceived economic burden is more
                                                            common among poor houses. They are married at a young age and less dowry is expected for younger brides.</p>
                                                            <p>2. BETROTHAL- A custom has a practice where girls are promised in marriage even before they are born. This is apparently done in order to make them secure about their future.</p>
                                                            <p>3. LEVEL OF EDUCATION- Many people consider girls to be a ‘Paraya Dhan’ which means someone else's wealth. Because of this, less priority is given to girl child education.</p>
                                                            <p>Also, there are many other factors like household labour, traditions, customs, beliefs, violence
                                                                against girls, etc.</p>

                                                    <p>
                                                        In Ancient Greece, early marriage and motherhood for girls was encouraged. Even, boys were
excepted to marry in their early age. In Ancient Rome, boys were married above the age of 14
years and girls above 12 years.
Child marriage was outlawed in 1929. Under Indian law during the British Colonial times, the
legal minimum age of marriage was set at 18 years for boys and 14 years for girls.
The history of child marriage in India dates back to pre-colonial times as it is considered that the
concept was present in early religious texts. The practice of child marriage was examined more
heavily when India was colonized.
Colonizers used to label the Indians as ‘Barbarians’, however they did not intervene or attempt to
end the practice out of fear of resistance from the Indians.

The data says 44% of girls in Niger are married before the girls attaining 18 years of age and
18% of girls are married before the age of 15 years.
According to UNICEF, Niger has the third highest absolute number of child marriage brides in
the world which is, 3,538,000 and it is at the 11th highest prevalence rate of child marriage
globally.
As per 2017 World Bank Study, it is estimated that child marriage costs Niger USD 7.6 billion in
lost earnings and productivity every year.
According to the 2017 UNICEF Report, State of The World's Children, the countries with the
highest rates of child marriage before age 18 years are as follows:

                                                        Initially, the Child Marriage Restraint Act ,1929 was brought into force as the social reforms group and individuals campaigned against the child marriage. But, this act however, failed due to
multiple reasons. The offence was also reported rarely since the act itself prohibited complaints
after 1 st year of marriage. Even in this act, women solemnizing marriage are not punishable but
the men are punishable, thereby contradicting the Article 14 which is the Right to Equality in the
Indian Constitution. The new act ‘Prohibition of Child Marriage Act’ was introduced in the year
2006. Many of these problems that were faced in the previous act, that is, Child Marriage
Restraint Act was legally addressed but the societal and cultural practice of child marriages still
continue to exist.
Child marriage affects not only the basic rights to freedom and life, but also has a negative
impact on the reproductive health of a girl child. Due to this, the rate of maternal and infant
mortality rate is high in case of child marriages.
Though the new act has come into force but, still there are loop holes like the act is inconsistent
with personal law. Since, few communities personal law still allows child marriage, and the
Prohibition of Child Marriage Act simultaneously tries to prevent them, the conflict leads to
signification legal complication. Also, registration of marriages has not been made compulsory
under this marriage which further leads to a lot of unreported child marriages.

                                                    <p> 
                                                        Violence against women and children remains a serious public concern till date. A survey says
that, in India every hour at least 2 women are being harassed. Violence against women is referred
to as physical or sexual violence committed against women in India. In a study, it shows that
around 10,000 women have experienced physical violence or sexual harassment from spouses.
Although, violence is threat for everyone but women are specially victims because they often
have knowledge of their rights. Unfortunately, the violence against women in India is increasing
due to support by patriarchal and social norms.

                                                    <p>
                                                        There are several reasons behind violence against women in India such as, refusal to have
physical relations, refusal to take care of the in-laws, character assassination and so on. All these
points towards the lack of our educational system as well as the lack in the existing framework of
laws. Violence against women is consider as a public health problem in world. Violence as
defined by the World Health Organization is the use of physical power or threatened to person or
group or community that results to injury, death, depression etc.</p>
                                                        
                                                        <p>In India, Delhi is considered as the Rape Capital of India where the most infamous case of
                                                            Nirbhaya Gang Rape happened. Rape is the most common crime in India. At the same time,
                                                            marital rape is still not considered as a criminal offense. India is one of the fifty countries which
                                                            do not have a law on marital rape. A study says that atleast 20% of women in India are victims of
                                                            marital rape.</p>

                                                        The Present condition of women is determined from the early period. Her status cannot be
properly understood without knowing her past status. It is essential for understanding the
contemporary status of women in India for several reasons. The position of women was not
identical throughout the ancient period. But, mostly the women could not lead a free life and she
lived under pressure of her parents and later on of her husband or her son. The early law book
treated the women equivalent to the Shudras. In the Vedic age, there were high ideals of
womanhood. The Rig Veda had gently, but put the men into the right position. A woman was
protected by Gods and her earthly companion ‘The Man’ was considered her guardian who was
in no way superior to her. Throughout the Vedic Period, women were given equal status like
men. The position of the women in Rig Vedic period deteriorated in the later Vedic Civilization.
A daughter was then, regarded as a curse. All moral and social rules framed by the domestic
society ignored identity, individuality and integrity of the females.

    After the independence in India, women participated in all activities such as Education, Politics,
Media, Art, Culture service sectors, Science and technology etc. Woman participated in
administration work. For example, Mrs. Indira Gandhi who served as the Prime Minister of
India. The Constitution of India guaranteed all Indian women equality and no discrimination by
the state with equal opportunity and equal work etc. The feminist activism in India started in the
1970s. During this period, the media was developed by then, which helped in spreading
awareness for females and on the issues of gender biasness, women health and female literacy.
En number of self-help and Non-Governmental Organizations such as Self Employed Women
Association (SEWA) played a major role in women’s rights in India. Many women have
emerged as leaders of local movement, for example, Medha Patkar who played a major role in
the Naramada Bachao Andolan. But, also most of the male section in the society, still think that a
woman’s most important job is to take care of her husband and her children. An article on ‘Status
of Women in India – A Depressing Scenario’ which appeared in the tribune of Chandigarh
Edition on the 15 th of April, 1999 points out that on an average a rape takes place once in every
54 minutes, eve teasing in every 51 minutes, molestation once in every 26 minutes and dowry
deaths in 1000 minutes. The Government of India declared 2001 as the year of Women’s
Empowerment (Swashakti). The National Policy for Empowerment of Women was passed in
2001. On the 9 th of March, one day after International Woman’s Day, the Rajya Sabha passed the
Woman’s Reservation Bill, ensuring 33% reservation in Parliament and State Legislative Bodies.
In Ancient India, women held a high place of respect in the society as mentioned in the Rig Veda
and other scriptures. Volumes can be written about the status of our woman and the heroic deeds
from the Vedic Period to the modern times. But later on, because of social, political and
economic changes women lost their status and were related to the background of any evil

customs and traditions stepped in which enslaved the woman tied them to the boundaries of the
house. The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 is an Act of the Parliament
of India enacted to protect women from domestic violence. It was brought into force by
the Indian government on the 26 th of October, 2006. The Act provides for the first time in Indian
law a definition of ‘Domestic Violence’, with this definition being broadened and including not
only physical violence, but also other forms of violence such as emotional / verbal, sexual and
economic abuse. It is a civil law meant primarily for protection orders and not for meant to be
enforced criminally. Primarily meant to provide protection to the wife or female live-in partner
from domestic violence at the hands of the husband or male live-in partner or his relatives, the
law also extends its protection to women living in a household such as sisters, widows or
mothers. Domestic violence under the act includes actual abuse or the threat of abuse whether
physical, sexual, verbal, emotional or economic. Harassment by way of unlawful dowry demands
to the woman or her relatives would also be covered under this definition.

                                                        The number of women reported to have been victims of violence in their lifetimes and those whoreport violence in past years is high many countries. Across OCED countries, 22% of the women
report of having experienced physical or sexual violence from an intimate partner in their
lifetimes with more than 4% woman having experienced intimate partner violence in the past
year. More than one third of women in New Zealand, the United States and Turkey report having
experienced interpersonal violence from a partner. In 14 countries, the legal framework protects
women from violence including intimate violence, rape and sexual harassment without any legal
exception. In OCED, in 16 countries survivors of violence still face legal obstacles. SIGI 2019
shows that within OECD countries, 8% of women say that a husband may be justified in hitting
or beating his wife, from 1% or less in Denmark and Ireland to up to 18% in Korea and 20% in
Germany. In emerging economies, acceptance of violence against women can be much higher –
34% of women in Indonesia and 61% of women South Africa say that spousal violence can be
justified. A recent Global Study on Homicide, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crimes
finds that while men are more likely to be victims of homicide, women killed by intimate
partners or family members account for 58% of all female homicide victims. Gender-related
killing of women and girls is a global phenomenon, with the highest rates of women and girls
intentionally killed in Africa and in North and South America. On average across OECD
countries, almost one women in three report of not feeling safe when walking alone at night,
compared to one in five for men. Women feel safer in Iceland, Norway, Slovenia, Spain and
Switzerland, where less than one in five women do not feel safe. By contrast, in Latin America,
around six women out of ten report not feeling safe. Women from Brazil and South Africa report
the highest shares at above 70%.

Ever since the COVID-19 issue have emerged, it is the labour, working or marginalised class
people who are highly affected. WHO declared COVID-19 as highly disastrous on
11.03.2020, which shall impact thousands of lives worldwide The most substantial and
concerning matter is rise of the working class people who are left without daily employment,
payment of wages to workers for the time they have been unable to work due to pandemic.
Even the most highly sector industries employees have suffered the beans of the disease.
There has emerged a distrust between the employee and employers. Many of the companies
simply abandoned their workers. </p>
<p> The first Labour legislation Act was in 1883, The Factories Act, which has provided several
guidelines to govern the act of employers and employees. Under the rule of British, our
country was truly exploited in terms of socially, economically, financially drained by the
colonial people. After Independence, India aimed to base the foundation upon the principles
of a Socialist, Economic and strive for the Welfare of the society. In recent years, various
implementation and programmes been introduced by the government to reform and regulate
labour &amp; help them to have a convenient and encouraging working environment and facilities
provided by government. Due to the emergence of pandemic, Indian labour society will
witness a massive transformation in future as well. There have always been unlikely relation
between the working class. Philosopher like, Karl Marx, have also thrown light upon the
relation between the proletariat and bourgeois class. In Marxist Theory, there struggle shown
between the capitalists and the working class .The have Labours have subjected to various
kinds of atrocities and faced ill-effects and maltreatment perceived to them during the crisis.
The consequences &amp; repercussion of the crisis has affected all class of people, but the
socially-economically deprived groups have to bear the brunt of the crisis in the most tragic
possible way.</p>

groups of workers and labour groups have migrated back to their state. Several cities and
small scale industries have become work deficit, as a large majority of these workers have
migrated back to their towns. Due to closure of small scale industries, many had to lose their

providing adequate food for their family. In various organisation the working hour also have
extended which ruled against the Factories Act. The working hour were earlier fixed to
specific time while during the pandemic it has increased to 12 hours per day and 72 hours per
week.</p>

The Motilal Committee Report of 1928 simply seems to be inevitable privileges to be granted to the individual derived by the Bill of Rights respected throughout the American Framework. Such privileges were covered by the

                                                        Principal rights are also known as Inalienable Rights since; by conception they are inborn to any adult. These are the rights that offer the survival incentive to an individual with a few

There is no apartheid under the basis of ethnicity, gender, sex, etc., and in the case if every person thinks so that his/her constitutional rights are infringed at that stage he will certainly approach the court for infringing his/her rights.</p>

                                                        democratic community cannot live in an ethical manner. They are also recognized as negative
                                                        rights or rights of the individual, as they impose negative obligations on the state such that it may not infringe the independence of the citizen. Such protections are of a fair sort such that one can appeal before the courts because one is unlikely to have violated one's right or encroached.
                                                        Fundamental rights are enshrined in Part III of Indian Constitution from Article 12-35.

                                            <p>Consumer is a person or a group of persons who orders or uses purchased goods, products, or
even services for household, personal, social and similar needs. But, such purchases must not
directly relate to entrepreneurial or business activities. Consumers are the driving force of the
economy. Consumers play a vital role in the society from the method they use to research and
review products to decision on which brand to use and from where to make purchase. The
moment an individual comes into this world, he starts consuming. In short, consumer is a user of
goods and services, therefore, every producer is also a consumer. Thus, we all are consumer in
the literal sense of terms. When a person approaches the market as a consumer, he expects value
for money and has certain rights. But, there may be cases where consumers are harassed or
cheated. To protect the interest of the consumers, many laws have been made, like, the Sale of
Goods Act, the Indian Contract Act, the Prevention of Food Adulteration act, etc. However,
these laws require the consumer to take action through a civil suit. Such actions involve lengthy
legal procedures which are very expensive and time consuming. This paved the way for
enactment of the Consumer Protection Act in the year 1986. The act provides simple, quick and
easy remedy to consumers under three tier Quasi-Judicial Redressal Agency at the District, State
and National level. To make the act more effective and meaningful, necessary changes have been
made by bringing Consumer Protection (Amendment) Act, 2002, which came into force with
effect from the 15 th of March, 2003. Before 1986, the Sale of Goods Act of 1930 was the source
of consumer protection in India. The Consumer Protection Act, 1986 have an objective to
provide justice which is less formal and involves less paperwork, give justice in minimum delay
and with less expenses. The new act proposes a slew of measures and tightens the existing rules
to further safeguard consumer rights.
But, now, consumers can have more relaxation as the 3-decade old Consumer Protection Act,
1986 has been replaced in 2019. The new act introduces a central regulator, strict penalties for
misleading advertisements and also guidelines for e-commerce and electronics service providers.</p>

                                            <p>The term tort is a French word, in English which means'Wrong'.
                                            The word ‘Tort’ is derived from the Latin word ‘Tortum’, which means twisted or crooked.
                                            A person who commits a tort is known as ‘Tortfeasor’ or a ‘Wrongdoer’.
                                            Its wrongful act is called a Tortious Act.
                                            In tort, there is no appropriate remedy that is, damages are not specified and it shall be
                                            decided by the court.
                                            However, every wrong or wrongful activity is not a tort. Therefore, to constitute a tort there
                                                must be 3 elements:</p>

                                                        <p>All damages are not legal damages that is, damages in the eyes of law. Damages will only be
                                                            called as legal damages when it has arisen from legal injuries.in simple words, there should
                                                            be a violation of legal rights. In the absence of infringement of legal rights, an action cannot
                                                            be taken. This will be more clear with the help of two maxims:</p>
                                                        <p>(i) Damnum sine injuria: Damnum means damage, loss, harm concerning money, comfort, health, etc. Whereas
                                                            injuria means the violation of legal rights. This maxim means yet such damages are not
                                                            actionable in tort.
                                                            The famous case of this maxim is Glouster Grammar School Case. In this case, the
                                                            defendant, a schoolmaster, set up a rival school next to that of the plaintiff, with the
                                                            result that the students from the plaintiff's school flocked to the defendant's. The
                                                            plaintiff sued the defendant for the loss suffered by him. It was held that no suit could
                                                            lie because bonafide competition can afford no ground of action, whatever damage it
                                                            may cause.</p>
                                                        <p>(ii) Injuria sine damnum: It means injury without damage i.e. where there are no damages occurred yet such
                                                            activity is actionable in tort. Similarly, when there is an infringement of the privacy
                                                            rights of an individual, there is legal injury and the plaintiff can file a suit and it shall be
                                                            actionable under tort.</p>
                                                        <p>The leading case of this maxim is Ashby v. White (Refusal to register vote) in this case
                                                            person was wrongfully disallowed to vote, the candidate for whom the vote was sought

                                                            the plaintiff&#39;s vote. The court held nevertheless the suit would succeed because the legal
                                                            rights were injured.</p>

                                                    <p> Earlier, there were no such things as civil laws or criminal laws. The judgments were given on a
                                                        case to case basis. The punishment given to the defendants was sometimes harsh and strict. The
                                                        only way to run out of that was to become a member of the clergy, whose cases were to be dealt
                                                        in the Ecclesiastical courts, which were known to offer less punishment as compared to others.
                                                        Archbishop Thomas Beckets was the first person who set up the concept of civil courts. His
                                                        court was first known as the Court of Chancery, later as Courts of Equity and thereafter as, Civil
                                                        Courts.
                                                        In India, the Law of Tort came through England. After the Norman Conquest, French became the
                                                        most spoken language in England's judiciary and thus, many of the English law's technical terms
                                                        owe their origin to French and tort is one of them. The term 'tort' is based on the concept that
                                                        everyone has certain rights in the society. The purpose of this law is to enforce rights and duties

                                                    <h5 class="text-uppercase">INTRODUCTION</h5>
                                            <p>When an individual has an intention to commit a wrongful act, the person is said to commit a
                                                crime. To commit a criminal offense, it is important that there is actus rea that is, an act or
                                                conduct, along with mens rea, which means criminal intent. Indian Penal Code has introduced
                                                a new concept after the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1913. They added the term ‘Criminal
                                                Conspiracy’. Criminal Conspiracy basically means an agreement to commit an offence.
                                                Earlier, conspiracy was considered to be a civil wrong. Under IPC, conspiracy is punishable
                                                only in two conditions:</p>
                                                <p>1. Conspiracy by way of abetment.</p>
                                                <p>2. Conspiracy involved in certain offences. For example, robbery.</p>
                                                <p>However, with time, the concept of conspiracy has widened and it was decided that when two
                                                    or more persons agree upon committing an unlawful act, or do a crimeful act through
                                                    administration of any unlawful means, it is said to be punishable under the IPC. Hence, under
                                                    the IPC, an act is said to be punishable even when a person has intention and not yet
                                                    performed the crime. The definition was further elaborated under Section 121 A of the Indian
                                                    Penal Code, 1870.</p>
                                                <h5 class="text-uppercase">DEFINITION OF CRIMINAL CONSPIRACY UNDER IPC:</h5>
                                                <p>Under section 120A, it defines Criminal Conspiracy as:
                                                    “when;</p>
                                                    <p>1. Two or more persons,</p>
                                                    <p>2. agree to do, or cause to be done –
                                                        a. An illegal act, or
                                                        b. And act which is not illegal by illegal means, such an agreement is designated a
                                                        Criminal Conspiracy, provided that,</p>
                                                        <p>3. no agreement except and agreement to commit an offence shall amount to a Criminal
                                                            Conspiracy, unless some act besides the agreement is completed by one or more
                                                            parties to such an agreement in pursuance thereof. For instance, an L.L.B student who
                                                            had applied for the verification and photo-copy of his paper in ‘Law of Contract’
                                                            wanted to get his result at the earliest point of time (legal act). For this purpose, he
                                                            conspires with the University clerk to give five hundred rupees to the University
                                                            
                                                            Controller of Examination, so as to induce the controller to declare his result (illegal
                                                            means). He can be held liable for criminal conspiracy.</p>
                                                            <p>Explanation: It is immaterial whether the illegal act is that the ultimate object of such
                                                                agreement, or is merely incident to that object.</p>
                                                                <p>Essential elements of a crime: Person, Mens Rea, Actus Rea, Injury.</p>
                                                                <p>Conspiracy does not essentially have to be written or formal. All that is required is mutual
                                                                    understanding and common goal to perform an unlawful act. Secondly, all the conspirants
                                                                    must have the knowledge of the crime and each of them have participated in some or the
                                                                    other way in formatting the crime. If a person who is entirely unaware of the crime and has no
                                                                    knowledge of it and he is participating in a crime cannot be charged with conspiracy. For
                                                                    instance, A and B have plan to rob a bank and asked C to drive them to the bank without
                                                                    informing C of their intent to rob the bank, hence C cannot be charged with conspiracy in
                                                                    robbing. There is a plan between A, B, C but initially it does not involve D. D has
                                                                    participated at the 4 th stage of executing plan, but was not at the beginning of the plan, even
                                                                    then D will be punished under conspiracy , as he later got involved in the same plan for
                                                                    taking to its final stage.</p>

                                                    <p>1. Conspiracy law tests the bounds of First Amendment rights as it allows prosecutors to
                                                        use normally protected acts like attendance at meetings, speech, and group against a

                                                            an accused co-conspirator who has indirectly done or said the criminal things which is
                                                            alleged, as courts inclined to be quite liberal in acknowledging evidence of
                                                            association. In some cases, prosecutors often file conspiracy charges so as to be ready
                                                            to use that evidence as only means to loosely connect with a specific defendant.</p>
                                                            <p>3. It is unclear in conspiracy case whether a defendant is deliberately committing a

                                                mode of the procedure when the cause of action arises. On the other hand, Section 80 of the
                                                C.P.C. is not a procedural provision but a substantive one the rules involved in it and working of
                                                Section 80 will discuss further. Lastly, Order 27 includes under its ambit various rules and
                                                subjects like that of recognized agents, attorney general and the procedure to be followed while
                                                the suit is being filed by or against the government or public officers in official capacity. This

                        <h5>IMPACT ON ECONOMY</h5>
                        <p>The threat of being exposed to electronic cash fakes is consequently incredibly high. In 2011,
                            Norton Cybercrime announced that more than 74 million individuals in the Joined States were
                            perpetrators of cybercrime in 2010, which primarily resulted in monetary misfortunes of about
                            $32 billion Indeed, in India, with the rise and ubiquity of 'cashless India', online trickery
                            chances are also increasing, in case one is not knowledgeable enough to use secure online
                            exchange stages and apps. Due to cybercrimes, unfair people are suffering from money-related
                            misfortunes.</p>
                            <h5>LEAKAGE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h5>
                            <p>Not equal monetary misfortunes, citizens too suffer spillage of individual details. Numerous
                            social gathering sites, however stable they can be, are always an accessible stage for anyone to
                            see the existence of everyone else, and may be dangerous. In fact, programmers can break into
                            one's account independently from this to obtain any data they require. Spamming and phishing also cause Personal harm</p>
                            <h5>LOSS OF CONSUMER TRUST</h5>
                            <p>With these monetary misfortunes and a danger to individual records, shoppers start losing confidence in these locations and applications. Nevertheless, in the case that somebody else is  the one performing the crime, the position or device is declared to be incorrect and risky. It also allows individuals reluctant to initiate an exchange while inquiring regarding their credit card information. This affects an e-business legitimacy, which ultimately undermines a future transaction.</p>
                            <h5>THE THREAT TO NATIONAL SECURITY</h5>
                            <p>Many nations armies are using sophisticated technological technologies and devices these days.Data fighting, however ancient, is used to spread malware, which can cause crashes to be arranged and deception to spread. Not only military, but fear-based oppressors and cybercriminals are also making such developments in barge protection structures in other countries and having info. Therefore, they submit hazards and warnings that code frameworks.</p>
                            <h5> CONCLUSION</h5>
                        
 <p>To sum up, given the reality that a free culture without crime is idealized and occurs as it is in
    figment, it would be a straightforward practice with laws to mitigate the criminality. Within a
    world that is highly reliant on creativity, crime focused on online law-breaking is likely to
    propagate and the developers of law have gone the extra mile relative to the impostors, to keep
    them at bay.
    Innovation is a double-edged sword on an ongoing basis and can be used for both great or awful
    purposes. Steganography, Trojan horse, Rummaging (and indeed Dos or Don’ts) are all
    innovations, not violations per se, but falling into the off-base hands with an unlawful
    expectation of abusing or abusing them, they enter the cybercrime cluster and become guilty of
    criminal offences.  </p>

                                                    <h5 class="text-uppercase">INTRODUCTION</h5>
                                            <p>Our Constitution, says that Equality before law that is, the state shall not deny to any person equality
                                                before the law or the equal protection of the law within the territory of India. If the functionaries of the
                                                law become the law-breakers, it is bound to breed contempt for the law and encourage lawlessness.
                                                Article 14 of Indian Constitution does not discriminate equality among its member, even when a
                                                person has committed a crime or murder, they are bound to be protected and treated equally on the basis of
                                                the article. They shall not be deprived of their rights even when they, steal murder, theft or etc. If a police
                                                tries to break the law by punishing the criminals by themselves, this would basically lead to “anarchism”.
                                                The police are, no doubt, under a duty to arrest a criminal and interrogate them; but the law does not
                                                allow the use of third degree methods to torture the accused while in police custody with a view to
                                                solve the crime.</p>
                                                <p>Article 21 of Indian Constitution protects life and personal liberty by providing that &quot;No person shall
                                                    be deprived of his life or personal liberty” except according to the procedure established by law.And
                                                    so it also includes right to live with human dignity and a guarantee against torture and assault by the state.
                                                    That means, a police cannot use its arbitrary power to suppress or use their torture tactics upon the
                                                    criminals to solve their cases. Usage of inhumane method and technique is strictly condemned by any
                                                    constitution. Every individual living in a country has his/her own human rights and they have an
                                                    absolute power to protect it under any circumstances, even if he is a prisoner. They must also be treated with dignity. But it is seen that custodial torture is a naked violation of human dignity which destroys the individual completely. And in that case they cannot even complaint or cry it to their family because of the fear and agony. The real concern in such cases is not the infliction of bodily pain, but also the
                                                    mental agony, grief, suffering which a person undergoes within the four walls of the lock-up or police station.</p>
                                                    <p>There's a very prominent case of, “D.K Basu v. State of West Bengal, wherein it dealt with custodial deaths and various forms of custodial torture, and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment of prisoners and other persons being questioned by the police. And also regarding deaths of prisoners in police custody and lock-ups. After this issue, the Supreme Court has laid downs various guidelines to be followed while arresting a prisoner and keeping them in lock-up. The Article 22 leads to protection against arrest and detention in certain cases. There are certain cases when the police use their power and force an innocent to accept the crime, even when they haven't committed it, only for the sake of promotion. There have also been a lot of fake encounter which is a held by the police without providing relevant data. One such recent case was from Tamil Nadu where both father and his son were beaten to death. Another prominent case from Hyderabad of a Veterinarian Doctor, she was raped by four accused. After the investigation the police have arrested all the four of them, and also these rapists have accepted their crime. But in the midst of it, the police wanted to re-create the crime scenario in which they took the criminals to the crime scene and they shot to death all the four accused claiming that they were trying to escape. Extra- judicial murder by police only makes the country more dangerous for women, children and the marginalized people. Serving speedy justice is important in such cases but the medium through which the justice is served is misleading. Giving the police, who all are known to be the most morally bankrupt group in India, the freedom to kill at its will is OUR OWN FUNERAL. If we normalize the encounter killing, custodial deaths, it will be the most marginalized groups who will have to bear the burnt in the future. Our country should make our judiciary system more efficient and speedy dealing with such cases.</p>
                    
                                                                    <h5 class="uppertext">CONCLUSION</h5>
<p>Police force is the one who should reform the law and not break it. The legal system exists
    for a reason. If the savior of the Law, itself become the destructive of the rules, there will definitely
    be contempt, rage, disappointment, misery among the citizens towards the police. Custodial killings
    don't make me any safer; it tells me that the police are above the law. That they are no different than
    the mob that lynch, it only makes me fear the police. The Supreme Court has remarked that the word
    “torture” is, synonymous to the darker side of human civilization. In spite of all these provisions,
    morning newspapers carry, almost every day, reports of dehumanizing torture, assault, rape and
    deaths in police custody. There's a saying of Supreme Court that, 'Society's cry for justice becomes
    louder<p>

                                                    <h5 class="text-uppercase">INTRODUCTION</h5>
                                            
<p>There are two applications of rights: horizontal and vertical. According to the classical model,
    Constitutional Rights are made to regulate the relationship between the individual and the State,
    acting as a check upon State power, and enforceable ‘vertically’ by the individual against the
    State. These rights are not supposed to apply to interactions or transactions between private
    parties. Such interactions or transactions against the private party are to be regulated by the
    common law, or by legislatively enacted statutes. Earlier, it was seen that the common law was
    deemed sufficient to protect whatever rights individuals might have had against each other. But
    due to the increase of growing private power and the retreat of the welfare State, feminist
    critiques of the public/private distinction, an expanded conception of rights, or some combination
    of all three. Constitutional courts, therefore, have developed various ways in which a person can
    apply rights 'horizontally' – i.e., to apply rights in transactions where private parties are
    involved in some or the other way.<p>
        <p>In simple words, horizontal rights are applied against private parties while the vertical rights are
            right can be applied only against public authorities. A horizontal application was first started in
            Ireland. In Ireland, the court adopted an approach where it can start action against private
            individuals under the principle of Sui Generis (of its kind/unique) and deemed that wrong as
            constitutional tort and start enforcing right against private individuals. Later, this approach was
            adopted by many countries and India was also one of them.
            The Horizontal Application can be applied in two ways:
            1. Direct Horizontality
            2. Indirect Horizontality</p>
            <h5>DIRECT HORIZONTALITY</h5>
            <p>Indian legal system has always shown unwillingness towards the application of direct horizontal
                application. The Supreme Court of India has always stood on the opinion that fundamental right
                given under the Indian Constitution, in case of violation of any article can only be enforced
                against the public authorities and not private individuals. Our Constitution was framed to achieve
                social change and the framers of the Constitution mandated that certain provisions of the
                constitution are to be applied against every person i.e. public as well as private individuals. This
                is evident from Articles 15(2) (Prohibition of Discrimination), Article 17(Abolition of
                Untouchability), Article 23 and Article 24(Right against Exploitation). These provisions provide
                for direct horizontality which means that these provisions are to be applied against the state and
                private individuals. But the Courts have failed to give full effect to these provisions. In the case
                of PUCL v. Union of India where the Court held that the state must make sure that private
                persons comply with Article 23 of the Constitution.</p>
                <p>In the case of MC Mehta v State of Tamil Nadu, the court found that the employment of the
                    children in the cracker factory violates Article 24 of child labor prohibition. The court ordered
                    the employer of the cracker factory to pay compensation to the children. Hence we can say that
                    in this case, the court to enforce the horizontal application has applied the horizontal effect of the
                    fundamental right. Based on the various instances given above we can say that unless and until
                    we apply the horizontal effect then the benefit of the fundamental rights will not be able to be
                    enjoyed by the citizens in the truest sense. Such applications of fundamental rights compel an
                    individual to be a responsible citizen and discharge their duties in a bona fide manner.</p>
                    <h5>INDIRECT HORIZONTALITY</h5>
                    <p>In some cases, Fundamental Rights do not require Direct Horizontality, therefore to widen the
                        scope of these rights it is necessary to look for an alternative theory. In the case of Indirect
                        Horizontality, the constitution rights instead of directly regulating the non-state parties regulate
                        them indirectly by imposing a duty on them through law. There are two ways to exercise this
                        effect. In the first method, the duty is imposed on the government to protect the private
                        individual against other private individuals and where the Constitution is silent on issues but are
                        implied for the realization of the objective of the Constitution. In the second method, the court
                        applies the Constitution right to private law like Property law, Family law, etc. Thus, we can say
                        that here instead of focusing on the individual directly it can govern all law which applies to the
                        individual in India indirectly. Indirect Horizontal application has been used in many cases. One
                        of the famous cases in Rajasthan that is, Vishaka v State of Rajasthan, where one worker got
                        raped by some miscreant. In this case, the Supreme Court has used an indirect horizontal
                        approach by giving guidelines against sexual harassment. In this case, a positive obligation was
                        imposed on the state for the protection of the private individual from sexual harassment at the
                        workplace. Indirect Horizontal effect in this way penetrates the social setup where there is a
                        legislative gap exists and decrease the rift between the public and private sector. In the case of
                        Zoroastrian Cooperative V. District Registrar, the Supreme Court held that the members of a Co-
                        operative Society had the freedom and the right to prevent any people from any other community
                        to live in the society as the housing society was not stated within the meaning of Article 12, and
                        this freedom overrode the right of the individual against non-discrimination based on caste, race,
                        religion, etc. Later, the Court upheld the impugned legislation, as well as the bye-laws, that
                        permitted and authorized the Society to exclude people purely based on religion.</p>
                        <h5>CONCLUSION</h5>
<p>In the ongoing scenario, the private bodies which are not the state can also infringe on the rights
    of the public, so fundamental rights should be enforced again them as well. The court should
    acquire such a course of reasoning while determining cases where the body does not solely fall
    inside the definition of the state. In my viewpoint, if we acquire the horizontal approach then
    firmly the violation of the private act can be checked to a greater extent.</p>

    application for registration.</P>
    <H5>Example of Design</H5>
<P>For example, the shape of an apple if applied to school bag would be registrable.</P>
<H5>CONCLUSION</H5>
<P>Intellectual Rights are monopoly rights that grant their holders temporary privilege for the
    exclusive exploitation of the income rights from cultural expressions and inventions. There must
    be good reasons for a society to grant such privileges to some of its individuals and therefore the
    proponents of these rights have provided three widely accepted justifications to defend the
    interwoven global intellectual property rights regime we have place today.</P>

<p>Many of the laws in India have become instruments of despotism or oppression rather than
    vehicles to regulate conduct. One of these laws is Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act,1957
    (UAPA). It is primarily meant to combat terror and forbid well known terrorists organizations.
    The latest amendment was made in the year 2019, July, in the Unlawful Activities (Prevention)
    Act. In the latest amendment, Parliament chose to forbid individuals and their activities by
    paving a way to name a person or persons as a terrorist even though they may have no
    connection with any of the 36 terrorist organizations as given in the first schedule of the act.<p>
        <p>In simple words, the UAPA, 1967 is meant to criminalise and impose penalties on unlawful and
            terrorist activities, which causes a threat to the integrity and sovereignty of India. The act also
            provides to the central government a wide ranging power to designated organizations as terrorist
            organisations and also impose penalties for taking part in such organisations. There was a
            significant change brought in the year 2019 amendment by giving central government the power
            to notify a person or say an individual as ‘terrorist’ under Schedule IV of the act. Before this
            amendment, individuals were not covered only organisations have been designated this way.</p>
            <h5>HISTORY</h5>
            <p>The Unlawful Activities Prevention Act, that is, UAPA was first time passed in year 1967 on the
                recommendation of the National Integration Council, after being proposed and withdrawn twice.
                The UAPA came into force as a backdrop of the 1962 China war and 1965 Pakistan war and in
                response to secessionist demand made by the regional groups like the Dravida Munnetra
                Kazhagam. The act that is, UAPA 1967 allowed the government to impose reasonable
                restrictions on the fundamental right to association that is, Article 19. The history of the UAPA
                could be originated from British India. The term ‘unlawful associationʼ was first used in the
                Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1908 to criminalise the Indian National Movement.</p>
                <p>In the 2004 and 2008 the UAPA was amended under the United Progressive Alliance (UPA)
                    regime, to incorporate provisions from the earlier Prevention On Terrorism Act (POTA) and
                    Terrorist And Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act (TADA). The last amendment was made in
                    the year 2019.</p>
                    <h5>COMPARISON</h5>
                    <p>Unlawful Activity Prevention Act is an Indian law aimed at effective prevention of unlawful activities
                        associations in India.
                        The comparison of UAPA with USA Country. The UAPA in USA is known as Patriot Act.
                        The USA PATRIOT ACT an Act of the United States Congress that was signed into law by U.S.
                        President George W. Bush on 26 th of October, 2001. USA PATRIOT is an acronym that stands
                        for Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept
                        and Obstruct Terrorism.
                        The Patriot Act was written following the September 11 attacks in an effort to dramatically
                        tighten U.S. national security, particularly as it related to foreign terrorism. In general, the act
                        included 3 main provisions:
                        1. Expanded abilities of law enforcement to surveil, including by tapping domestic and
                        international phones
                        2. Eased interagency communication to allow federal agencies to more effectively use all
                        available resources in counter terrorism efforts
                        3. Increased penalties for terrorism crimes and an expanded list of activities which would qualify
                        someone to be charged with terrorism.</p>

        appeals have been filed by the appellant.</P>
        <H5>PETITIONS</H5>
        <P>1.The Public Interest Litigation (PIL) was filed by Sajal Awasthi against UAPA, 2019 in the
            Supreme Court to declare it unconstitutional as it violates the basic fundamental rights. He said it
            indirectly curtailed the right to dissent and was against Article 14 (right to equality), Article 19
            (right to freedom of speech and expression) and Article 21 (right to life) of the Indian
            Constitution. It does not provide any opportunity to the individual termed as a terrorist to justify
            his case before the arrest.</P>
            <P>2. Another petition is filed by the Association for Protection of Civil Rights contended that the
                new section 35 allows the centre to designate an individual as a terrorist and add his identity in
                schedule 4 of the Act while earlier only organizations. The amendment does not specify the
                grounds of terming an individual as a terrorist and that "conferring of such a discretionary,
                unfettered and unbound powers upon the Central government is antithesis to Article 14."</P>
<H5>CONCLUSION</H5>
<P>The government has time and again used harsh laws such as criminal defamation and sediment
    laws to silence disagreement. These laws are indefinite or uncertain and overly broad and have
    been used as tools of politics against critics showing a movement towards “thought-crimes.” The
    legislature realised that the purpose of this Act has violated human rights. The Amendment also
    violates the mandate of Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant
    on Civil and Political Rights.
    The above mentioned arguments have pointed out how the amendment puts fundamental rights
    of its citizens in jeopardy and threatens the mere existence of opposition. Under the semblance of
    such laws, the government has booked journalists doing their jobs and citizens fighting for their
    rights and justice.
    When such dreadful legislation takes away the rights of citizens, it's the duty of the Supreme
    Court to step in and reinstate faith in democracy. The Act mainly criminalizes acts on the basis
    of ‘ideology’ and ‘association’. Thus, it can be seen that the above are the signs of moving from
    democracy to autocracy.</P>

<p>As we manage with a widespread worldwide, governments around the world are progressively
    relying on data innovation to advance their battle against the infection. The latest debates on
    gathering and treating health knowledge to counter coronavirus carry this topic to a range of
    stages. It points to a struggle between two constitutional freedoms, which are, the Right to Life
    and the Right to Safety. The built-up discussion on rights says your rights' delight closes when it
    influences the ability of another person to appreciate theirs. The idea is to ensure that everyone is
    enjoying the freedoms, even in break with degree. In either event, we are today faced with an
    extraordinary situation, as if with its closeness it might threaten another human being's welfare.
    The Structure ensures the right to life and freedom under Article 21, but these main rights have
    never been treated as contradictory to each other for some time recently. Such rights are now
    contrary to each other, and in order to preserve life in its true, actual, and most basic context, we
    should give few opportunities that are cherished under India's system. The more opportunities we
    provide, the more noteworthy are the chances of preserving the right to life.<p>
        
            <h5>COVID-19</h5>
            <p>COVID-19 is an irresistible disease caused by a modern coronavirus which was recognized in
                December 2019 to begin with. Coronaviruses are a family of infections which are known to
                cause airborne contamination. However, there is no antibody to prevent COVID-19, so there is
                no specific medication for it except to control the side effects.
                By mid-March 2020, more than 150 nations had detailed COVID-19 cases, and more than
                200,000 cases were found around the world by the WHO detailed. More than 7,000 people had
                passed on, and the numbers proceeded to rise at a disturbing rate.</p>
                
                    <h5>CHAOS CREATED BY THE CORONA VIRUS</h5>
                    <p>According to a WHO survey, India ranks 184th out of 191 nations in terms of the share of GDP
                        spending on healthcare, with its government investing as much as 1.15% of GDP in the
                        healthcare sector. In 2019, on the other hand, India was among the world's beat 3 military
                        spenders investing 2.4 per cent of its GDP on guard. The removal of day-to-day wage employees
                        from their workplace conditions to their homes after the nation-wide lockout declaration reflects
                        on India's wretched execution as part of its social capital appraisal. It's related to saying here that
                        a nation's social capital alludes to the belief in govt stances of its society and its compliance with
                        rules. And the position is nothing superior with reference to the third parameter, that is, the
                        administration standard, with the Indian government having no advanced and appropriate law at
                        its beck and calling to negotiate with the well-being emergency of such an unusual scale. There
                        is no magic bullet for grappling with these complicated problems, without a doubt. But the
                        introduction of a wellness crisis system into our framework would certainly give the govt, both
                        the union and the state, a protective layer to protect the people.</p>

                        <h5>CONCRED EFFORTS</h5>
<p>In the history of free India for the primary period, lockdown has been a necessity of an hour
    owing to the danger raised by COVID 19. The flare-up of novel coronavirus has cleared the
    world astonished with India without exception. As Dr. Vivian Balakrishnan, Singapore's remote
    service, said, 'Corona infection is a corrosive measure of the nature of healthcare, the level of
    administration and the socio-economic condition of each nation social capital'.  It was January's
    assumption when COVID 19 was tried optimistic for starting of comprehension in India. Yet
    then the amount began increasing after that. The episode of COVID 19 was such that it led to
    plague in a few states and union Regions. In almost all the states and union Domains instructive
    teaching was closed, workplaces were closed and everyone was asked to work from home, all the
    visitor spots were closed, all devoted teaching, parks, movie theaters, exercise center, swimming
    pools and other exciting regions. Individuals were asked to use cover, keep separate socially and
    wash their hands as often as possible as much as practicable, among also other preparatory
    moves. PM Narendra Modi declared 14 hours’ cap to Janta Curfew Period on 22 nd March, 2020.
    After that in a few states and union Regions government issued total lockdown either in entire
    state or in a few locale of the state. Then on the 24 th , 2020 PM NARENDRA MODI announced
    an across the country lockdown for 21 days that is, lockdown for another 2 weeks. Once again at
    that point on the final day of lockdown 2 that is, on April 17, 2020 PM NARENDRA MODI
    encouraged a nationwide lockdown by May 31 , 2020 that is, lockdown 3 to be extended. PM
    NARENDRA MODI announced on 30 May that lockout in contaminant region would facilitate
    expansion until 30 June 2020. In addition, he announced that all administrations should continue
    in a staged manner starting on June 8, called Open</p>

    <H5>VALIDITY OF LOCKDOWN UNDER INDIAN CONSTITUTION</H5>
    <P>Whether such lockout is significant below Indian system or not, multiple complaints are raised.
        First of all, whether the state has the control to arrange such a lockdown and respond to it can be
        YES, on the off chance that at expansive it will benefit the open. There can be no rights from life
        in this sense ensuring the right to life Under Article 21 of the Indian Constitution is the most
        important fundamental right. The essence of COVID 19 is such that the Indian Wellbeing
        Foundation may not have the capacity to manage the situation as there have been fast spreads
        that are not open to the Covid 19 combined. There is no co-ordinate clause of the Indian system
        that is essentially right to well-being, but it is the legislative action that contributes to the
        embedding of the right to well-being as a vital right and this is part and parcel of Article 21 of
        the Indian constitution. The Right to Liberty, including independence of the citizen. In
        'Consumer Advice and Study Middle vs. India Union, Incomparable Court held that the right to
        well-being and restorative treatment is assured Under Article 21 of the Indian Constitution is
        therefore the right to well-being.
        Pre-eminent Court held in the state of Punjab vs. Union of India that the right to well-being and
        therapeutic care is guaranteed Beneath Article 21 of the Indian structure is crucial right in this
        way.
        Indian system has given us critical freedoms, but two of our vital freedoms are affected by the
        lockdown. First of all, it is acceptable to travel freely across the area of India which is guaranteed
        under Article 19 (1) (d) of the Indian Constitution and to fine-tune any appeals or to carry out
        any work, commerce or trade guaranteed under Article 19 (1) (g) of the Indian framework. Yet
        Article 19 (5) and (6) of the Indian Constitution, because delicate constraints may be placed on
        such privileges inside the standard free supplier's system, it is achieved through a properly
        controlled statute. Under Article 19 (5) and (6), the rules issued under the Fiasco Administration
        Act, 2005 qualify a sensible confinement.</P>
        <H5>LEGAL FRAMEWORK</H5>
        <P>The Central Government released Instructions encouraging shutdown within the country on

                Individual Bodies, Organizations, etc., had to remain closed as per the aforementioned
                Instructions. In turn, the Commercial & Private Foundations and Mechanical Foundations were

<P>Noting that the DM Act allows for 'the effective management of calamities is important. Under
    Section 2 (d) of the Act, the term 'disaster' has been defined as a tragedy, accident, misfortune or
    bad occurrence in every field arising from natural or man-made causes or as a consequence of
    folly or carelessness resulting in substantial existence or permanent misfortune or harm to the
    properties or ecosystem of the region under control. A National Catastrophe Administration
    Specialist (NDMA) was set up under the chairmanship of the Prime Serve for the administration
    of such calamity. NDMA was granted the duty to lay down the calamity management
    procedures, preparations and guidelines for ensuring a prompt and convincing response to
    calamity. In addition, NDMA has the authority to prescribe relief in the reimbursement of
    advances or to allow new credits to fiasco-influenced people on such concessional terms as may
    be appropriate. Comparatively, each government of the State has been allowed to set up a State
    Debacle Administration Specialist (SDMA) for the State, under Section 14 of the Act.</P>
    <H5>CONCLUSION</H5>
    <P>A nation cannot defend itself from a catastrophe like COVID-19 by merely improving the
        Healthcare Sector. Within the non-attendance of an immunization or any other component
        containing the disease, policymaking becomes primarily central. The arrangement with the
        government as it were being that of 'control of human behavior. That being said, any
        government control or approach controlling human behavior must be in comprehension with the
        arrival Structure, the Suprema Lex. There must be a delicate adjustment between forced confines
        and the individual's basic rights. In this landscape, the Indian government's law on the movement
        of dead bodies governs the proper to stately burial under the individuals' religion versatility.
        Citizens ought to look at and follow the laws, and support organized policy efforts to work with
        the common.</P>

                                                    <h5 class="text-uppercase">INTRODUCTION</h5>
                                            
<p>India has an Appellate form of structure, wherein the delegator power is distributed
    among three groups; the Legislative, Executive, & Judiciary. The legislative is the
    one which forms the rules & guidelines; the Executive administers it, and lastly,
    the Judiciary is certainly has a separate power base from the former structures.
    Judiciary is a body which provides justice to its citizens. Under Executory power,
    the police, army, navy and all the other forces are inclined and are basically, the
    ones who are responsible for the protection of its citizens. Police and other forces
    must reform the law and try to preserve the foundation base and work accordingly.<p>
        
            <p>The word ‘Accountability’ means to be responsible. Police being held accountable
                is of utmost important for maintaining the public’s faith in the system. The police
                force is constantly under a duty to provide a safe and protected environment to its
                citizens. Any irresponsibility on the part of any citizen must be held accountable.
                The Indian Constitution under Part III serves Fundamental Rights to its citizens
                which is protected, preserved & safeguarded by the administrative power and
                judiciary. Fundamental rights are the privileged rights which are entitled to its
                citizens. If in any case of infringement of fundamental rights, any citizen can file
                complaint & seek help to the Hon. Supreme Court or the Hon. High Court.</p>
                
                    <p>Every state has their own police base separate from other states. Police structure is
                        based upon discipline, maintenance, truth, militaristic and authoritarian rule and
                        there are positions of each officers wherein, the lower ranks have to obey the
                        orders of the senior, blindly. During the time of colonial rule, the Britishers
                        established Police Force Act, 1861 which failed to prove its efficiency. The Indian
                        Police Commissioner was appointed in July 1902, under the Chairmanship of Sir.
                        A. H. L Fraser who quoted;</p>

<p>“The police force is far from efficient; it is defective in training and organization;
    it is inadequately supervised; it is generally regarded as corrupt and oppressive;
    and it has utterly failed to secure the confidence and cordial cooperation of the
    people”.</p>

    <P>After the independence, all other aspects of sectors had gone through a change
        although, the police sector remained much of same. The Police Act, is an
        organized institution came into existence in the year 1861. The regulating body
        such as the politician and bureaucrat over the police remained the same, as before
        the Independence. There are states which have regulated and enacted new
        legislations to govern the police force. For example, The Police force in
        Maharashtra & Gujarat are governed by the Bombay Police Act 1951; in Kerala by
        the Kerala Police Act of 1960, in Delhi by the Delhi Police Act of 1978. The
        changes which bought in the Act after the Independence are more silent and remiss
        about the requirements of new democratic country. The National Human Rights
        Commission provides for The Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993 which also
        accounts to hold police in case of any misconduct. The NHRC certainly has done a
        lot of welfare for the citizen, making police accountable for their acts. Various
        Universal Human Rights of a citizen have also been infringed by the police
        personnel itself and yet the cases are not properly convicted. The National Crime
        Record Bureau reports of 2018 states out that of 89 cases registered against police
        officers for the violation of human rights, the police have submitted the charge
        sheet of only 25 cases while not single accused police personnel have been take
        accounted or convicted thoroughly.</P>

    <P>As the relation between the politicians and criminals becomes stronger, it is able to
        sabotage the faith and loyalties of the functionaries of the government at various
        levels. After a lot of criminalization of politics, it has led to shake the authority of
        police leadership, their working and discipline. Police force is based upon the
        hierarchical order if any the order is undermine the entire system gets shaken and
        becomes vulnerable to wrong influence. And more importantly, it trembles the
        faith of people on the police. However, there are indiscripencies which are
        followed in the commission, due to lack of functioning in the law governing
        bodies.</P>
<p>“In today's world, we have police which is under influenced by the politicians and
    so it his politicized. However it has become a pawn in the hand of its master. In
    exchange the police receive reward and price which has become essential for their
    survival".</p>
    <p>There's a constant debate upon Delhi police work over the riots held in February.
        Delhi police is been criticized a lot by the government as well as the citizens.
        Various Citizens have developed a scornful approach towards the police force after
        the riots. The allegations made upon Police was that they were not just inactive
        during the time of riots happening at JNU and Jamia Islamia but also, they had
        adequately participated & supported few sections of mob for pelting stones upon
        the students. On February 26, the Hon. Supreme Court while orally formulate
        Delhi Police, lack professionalism, ethics, & lack of independence. Over the past
        few months in 2020, the protest against the Citizenship Amendment Bill in Delhi
        have raised various concern towards the action of police force. Various news
        reports have shown that police are opting to brutality, torture, pelting of stones,
        usage of gas bombs and firing of live ammunitions to control these protest. The
        utmost question arises over here is, who is responsible to give police such absolute
        powers, are there any guidelines that the police force needs to adhere to and why
        exactly police is failing for the purpose it was established for that is, for the
        protection of citizens.</p>
        <p>A very prominent landmark case of D.K Basu v. State of West Bengal deals with
            the police accountability of killing criminals in prison and cruel, inhuman and
            degrading treatment of prisoners and the other person being questioned by the
            police. It was imperative to develop “custody jurisprudence” and to formulate
            guidelines for awarding compensation to the victim and in case of his death, to his
            family members. Article 22 of the Indian Constitution guarantees protection
            against arrest and detention in certain cases, laying down the procedural
            requirements as well as the rights of the person arrested. Detailed provisions are
            contained in the Criminal Procedure Code regarding powers of arrest and the
            safeguard which are required to be followed by the police to protect the interest of
            the arrested person.</p>
            <p>Another case of George Floyd, a 46-year-old black American man was killed in
                Minneapolis, Minnesota on May 25 th , 2020, during an arrest for allegedly using a
                counterfeit bill. A white police officer named, Derek Chauvin knelt on Floyd’s
                neck for almost eight minutes, while Floyd was handcuffed and lying face down,
                he was begging for his life and repeatedly saying “I can’t breathe”. Others officers
                named J. Alexander Keung and Thomas Lane restrained Floyd, while Officer Tou
                Thao prevented bystanders from intervening. During last two minutes, Floyd was
                motionless and had no pulse running while Chauvin ignored bystanders request to
                remove his knee, until the medics told him to. ”.Later, Derek Chauvin was charged
                for third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter, and later was added as
                second-degree murder. Other officers were also charged with aiding and abetting
                second-degree murder.</p>

                <p>Floyd’s death has set up subsequent protests against police brutality, police racism
                    and lack of police accountability. In June, the Minneapolis City Council took
                    action to ban chokeholds and require police officers to negotiate against the use of
                    excessive force by other officers, and enhance to restructure the police department
                    as a “new community- based system of public safety</p>
                    <p>After this incident, there was a great havoc and dispute created in the minds of the
                        huge masses worldwide. Large number of protests were also held which were
                        organized to hold the police accountable for its actions and the police officer who
                        shall be responsible for any such acts, shall be convicted for his/her crime and no
                        other police should ever make use of such inhumane tactics to resolve any case.</p>

                        <h5>CONCLUSION</h5>
                        <P>It is eminently vital for Police to hold the faith of the people. Being a section of the
                            Executive, it is the foremost authority of the police personnel to safeguard &amp;
                            secure the interests of the common masses. People have faith and belief upon the
                            working of the law to provide justice at whatsoever manner. The redressal
                            machinery of government must not get dominated by the wrath of the politicians.
                            There is an ongoing distrust between the police force and its citizens. The ultimate
                            motive behind the establishment of the police force was to protect its citizen at any
                            circumstances. Although, throughout the years it is seen that the police have
                            become the most morally bankrupt group working for its own interest and benefit.
                            And, at the same time, is under influence to a great extent by the politicians.
                            Although it is not the same for everyone. Police force must maintain sustainable
                            environment for everyone. It is observed that police violence, custodial deaths,
                            torture, destroys human dignity which destroys the individual. It is calculated
                            assault on human dignity and whenever human dignity is wounded, civilization
                            takes a step backwards. As observed by the Supreme Court, “The end cannot
                            justify the means”.</P>
